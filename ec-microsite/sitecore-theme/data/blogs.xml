<p>In our series of blog posts on <a title="Goodbye Intranet. Say Hello to the NowEnterprise." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">the virtues of the NowEnterprise</a>, we’ve covered the variety of benefits to upgrading your current Intranet to better <a title="Don’t Sweat the Annual Review. It’s time for the NowEnterprise." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-sweat-annual-review-time-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">manage your people</a>, <a title="Project Management: On-time and On-budget with the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/project-management-on-time-and-on-budget-with-the-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">projects</a>, and <a title="Find your Wolf Pack: Collaborative Sales with the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/find-wolf-pack-collaborative-sales-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">sell more effectively</a>. As we put our plan in motion to radically change the way people collaborate, we focused our “mobile-first” approach on making sure that it looks just as good on a phone or tablet as on your desktop.</p> <p>With that in mind, we created a modern tile design that is visually engaging, while making sure that everything you need, like live news feeds, current events, and photo galleries, is easy to find and always available at your fingertips.</p> <p>Rather than creating endless columns of confusing links, we introduced sliding panels that focus on productivity and personalization &#8211; so things like viewing your current tasks or tracking conversations across projects are a breeze.  We’ve even included a centralized applications menu for quick access to key functionalities on the fly.</p> <p>As we’ve stated before, our goal is to help you create a relationship with your employees that goes <a title="Millennials Just Want to Have Fun (with the NowEnterprise)" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/millennials-just-want-fun-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">much deeper than just information</a>… we want them to actually enjoy using it.</p> <p>This is just the beginning. Today’s emerging technologies are opening the door for a truly dynamic enterprise.</p> <p>What’s next for your enterprise? Watch the video below for our vision of the future.</p> <div class='embed-vimeo' style='text-align:center;'><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/98167595' width='700' height='394' frameborder='0'></iframe></div> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sneak-peek-nowenterprise/">A Sneak Peek at the NowEnterprise…</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

in all shapes and formats, none particularly helpful or intuitive. Most insurers are limited in what they can do with the paper EOB; it is difficult to change and involves many different departments and complex technology. However, when it comes to the digital version of claims information, there is an opportunity to really improve the experience. Dynamic features that aren’t available in a paper-based format can be leveraged online. The ability to provide a more interactive and personalized experience, one that reacts to the varying needs of the user, is a key benefit.</p> <p>These are a few of the most common complaints about paper-based EOBs:</p> <ul> <li>Too much information – the EOB doesn’t focus on the most important details or make them easy to understand.</li> <li>The format is complex and critical information is not at the top. However, based on our research, what is most important is not the same for all users.</li> <li>Accuracy is uncertain – the amount you “may” owe Provider? Should the user trust this information?</li> <li>What exactly is a network reduction?</li> <li>Too much insurance jargon – the terminology is unclear.</li> </ul> <p>With a digital approach to claims information, many of these issues can be resolved. Some of these are “table stakes”, others are items to consider for creating a truly robust user experience in your digital portal.</p> <ul> <li>At a minimum, provide an electronic version of the paper-based EOB. This will allow your user to “go paperless” and provide an alternative to receiving paper-based mail.</li> <li>Leverage basic visual cues – horizontal shading for rows, color indicators, icons, etc.</li> <li>Allow users to interact with their claims data in a variety of ways – allow sorting, grouping, and filtering of claims.</li> <li>Be accurate – update the information in as close to real-time as possible with accurate information that ties to the bill from the provider.</li> <li>Be specific – include the actual servicing provider’s information (not the billing provider information – this is commonly a source of confusion), and the actual provider versus the group or facility. Provide service line item level detail. Expose the math behind the calculations for those who want to understand how the payment amount was determined.</li> <li>Avoid jargon – wherever there is complex terminology, allow for contextual help. Include a visual indicator that allows the user to get clearly worded definitions, access to online chat assistance, or a visual tutorial.</li> <li>Understand there are different types of users – some who simply want access to basic information, and those who want to dig deeper. Design the interface with both of these types of users in mind. Create a clear, concise view, but allow for drilling down into detailed information.</li> <li>When a service is not covered, allow the user to get additional information. Tie benefits information to claim details and be specific to their plan.</li> <li>Add visual elements to display out of pocket and deductible information, but give people the option of tabular or graphical – and remember their preference.</li> </ul> <p>To provide a more integrated experience, consider taking on more advanced features such as allowing the user to pay a provider bill directly from the claims information. Companies like <a title="InstaMed" href="http://www.instamed.com/" target="_blank">Instamed</a> and banking institutions are starting to provide this capability. In addition, understand that the same interactions and approaches don’t work for everyone. Give people options on how to view information – even to the point of a customizable EOB layout for advanced users.</p> <p>The online claims summary and detail information can be much more flexible, real-time, and personalized than the traditional paper-based format. Take advantage of the opportunities this channel provides to better service your customers, and reap the benefits of  improving the customer experience, like better member retention and a reduction in call center calls.</p> <p><em>Need further proof?

<p>Most of us are familiar with the saying,<strong> “</strong><em>the most worthwhile things in life are often the most difficult</em>.” In other words, good things usually don’t come easily. We’ve published several blog posts on the <a title="Goodbye Intranet. Say Hello to the NowEnterprise

<![CDATA[
." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">virtues of the NowEnterprise</a>, which we feel is game-changing good. Here’s a description:</p> <p><em>The notion of a static enterprise is being redefined by today&#8217;s consumer experiences. Contemporary interactions, emerging technologies, and a new standard for design are driving the future of day-to-day business. Research shows that we adopt technology that we enjoy. The cross-section of aesthetics, personalization and smart connected technologies – in a truly mobile format – creates user experiences that are more enjoyable. This is what the NowEnterprise is about. </em></p> <p><em>It&#8217;s also a way to engage in an experience that is much deeper than just information. How do I connect and build relationships with the people around me? How do I connect with the culture? </em><a title="Career Development for Millennials: the NowEnterprise for the Next Generation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/career-development-millennials-nowenterprise-next-generation/" target="_blank"><em>How do I foster my career?</em></a><a title="The Future of the Knowledge Worker is the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/future-knowledge-worker-nowenterprise/" target="_blank"><em>How do I get it all done in a smarter way?</em></a></p> <p>We have also highlighted the many additional benefits related to <a title="Find your Wolf Pack: Collaborative Sales with the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/find-wolf-pack-collaborative-sales-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">collaborative selling</a>, <a title="Project Management: On-time and On-budget with the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/project-management-on-time-and-on-budget-with-the-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">managing projects</a>, and <a title="Don’t Sweat the Annual Review. It’s time for the NowEnterprise." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-sweat-annual-review-time-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">managing people</a>. There’s plenty of good. But what about the hard parts? Here, we’ll cover some of what we have learned as we’ve embarked on developing the NowEnterprise. We’ll share three challenges that we have overcome as we’ve worked to create a mobile friendly, enjoyable experience to make people more productive at work.</p> <p><strong>The SharePoint Experience</strong><br /> It’s almost impossible to find anyone who raves about the out of the box user experience delivered by SharePoint. Even with SharePoint 2013, the out of the box mobile experience falls well short of expectations in our tap and swipe world. That said, customizing the entire SharePoint UI would be an onerous task, consuming lots of time and money. Finding the appropriate balance between effort and value in customizing the UI is an important but challenging task. We ultimately decided to significantly customize critical pages, such as the home page, dashboards, and key landing pages, while limiting customizations to lower level pages and system pages.</p> <p><strong>The Form Factor(s)</strong><br /> In a mobile-first world, intranets and collaboration hubs shouldn’t be designed for a PC and then squeezed into tablet and smartphone formats. Responsive design is fine if truly done mobile-first. You must think through all aspects of the design, including content and functionality. Identifying what is needed in each screen format allows you to design a more usable solution that presents only appropriate elements to the user. For example, will users on a smart phone complete a complex HR form? Probably not, but tablet and PC users will. Managing all of the various scaling needs in one responsive (adaptive or fluid) UI is an interesting challenge – one that we’ll cover in detail with an upcoming technical blog post.</p> <p><strong>Utilizing Front-End “Frameworks”</strong><br /> Finally, to hit the marks above and deliver a truly rich multi-device experience, selecting the right technology is critical. In this case, that technology could be a front-end framework to help handle the many complexities associated with developing for multiple devices and browsers. Evaluating the options can become paralyzing, and the devil certainly lurks in the details when it comes to finding one that’s progressive and plays nice with SharePoint. Still, is a framework enough? What about getting into the core CSS of SharePoint? We’ve looked at all of these permutations. Stay tuned for our thoughts on this in a future post. There may not be one single right answer, but some are better than others. And as always with technology, those answers are always changing.</p> <p>The good news is that difficult tasks are by far hardest the first time, and get significantly easier once conquered. Our journey has allowed us to tackle these challenges and bring forward the knowledge and experience required to bring the NowEnterprise to life predictably and efficiently. Our mission is to radically change the way people engage and collaborate. The NowEnterprise is a key building block in realizing that mission. It’s not just a vision supported by smoke and mirrors. It’s very real.</p> <p>We look forward to collaborating on what we see as the intranet of the future, a radical departure from what we’re used to. Something to add to the conversation? We welcome your comments and questions below.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/journey-nowenterprise/">3 Obstacles on the Road to the NowEnterprise</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Recently, Forrester released a new report analyzing those companies demonstrating the biggest improvements in their 2014 Customer Experience Index &#8211; including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, who increased their CXi score 20 points over last year. The Forrester CXi ranks organizations based on consumer surveys that ask how enjoyable and easy a company is to do business with, and how well it meets consumer needs. BCBSIL’s twenty point jump put them among the top companies showing significant improvements this year. Forrester spoke to BCBSIL and other “most improved” organizations to find out what steps they had taken that led to these improvements. You can <a title="How Companies Improved Their Customer Experience Index Scores, 2014" href="http://www.forrester.com/How+Companies+Improved+Their+Customer+Experience+Index+Scores+2014/fulltext/-/E-RES113362" target="_blank">view the full report here</a>.</p> <p>One common feature was a focus on the consumer through digital experiences. Rather than giving customers what the organization <em>thought</em> they wanted, these companies took the time to understand customer needs and upgraded their sites with that in mind.</p> <p>According to the Forrester report, BCBSIL took significant steps last year to get to know their customers, and to align member portal features with members’ needs. In addition, as part of an effort to continually improve their member portal offerings, BCBSIL made it a priority to get quantitative data back from consumer visits.</p> <p>Tahoe Partners worked closely with BCBSIL on many of the initiatives that helped them to identify consumer needs, including developing journey maps depicting how users navigate through the site and targeting areas for improvement. These journey maps highlighted challenging spots where potential customers were dropping off before completing a purchase, as well as areas where there was significant interest and traffic around site features.</p> <p>With these opportunity areas well-defined, Tahoe leveraged our expertise in the health insurance space to help BCBSIL define requirements, improve interactions, create dynamic designs, and develop clear content for key features on their member portal. These upgrades included a redesigned claims experience, member level claims data, expanded self-service tools such as billing and payments, and improved content readability and management. We also tapped our customer experience capabilities to help BCBSIL design engaging sites that are easy to understand and navigate. Tahoe was a key partner in the overall effort to develop a consistent user experience across the site, and the Forrester report cites many of these specific items in its assessment of what helped drive BCBSIL’s dramatically improved score.</p> <p>In the Forrester data and elsewhere, we have seen tangible statistics that demonstrate how, by focusing on the consumer and understanding their needs from the start, health insurance companies can develop sites that increase initial conversion, improve member retention, and reduce call center volumes. It is critical to understand consumer needs, react accordingly, and measure and manage to ensure ongoing results. A best in class member portal is not about finding the perfect solution, but rather, understanding and continually addressing the ever-changing needs of the consumer.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/customer-focused-approach-pays-bcbsil-member-portal/">Customer-focused Approach Pays Off for BCBSIL Member Portal</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Why enable your field sales force with technology? To increase sales (duh.) That’s definitely the goal, but it was recently made obvious to me that companies are pursuing different approaches to achieve that goal. My enlightenment came as we hosted IT executives from several prominent Chicago-based food and beverage companies. Invitees included Kehe Foods, OSI, Reyes Holdings, Treehouse Foods, D&amp;W Finepack and Wirtz Beverage. One of the primary topics discussed was mobile sales enablement to help increase the effectiveness of the sales force. A few of these companies have already implemented a successful solution, while others are brainstorming on what would add the most value to their organizations. That right there was the “aha” moment for me. Some have figured it out, while others are still searching. Why?</p> <p>They’re trying to solve different problems. Here’s my take: it seems to come down to the nature of product or service being sold. If a product or service is differentiated, a visually rich and engaging mobile sales solution may help prospective buyers better <em>experience</em> the product or service and sway a purchase decision. If the product or service is highly commoditized, arming sales staff with real-time pricing tools to proactively position aggressively priced deals may best move the needle on sales. The three flavors of mobile sales enablement discussed by our food and beverage IT leaders can best be described by the category of product or service being sold – differentiated, competitive or commoditized.</p> <p><strong>Compelling visual presentation for differentiated products and services</strong><br /> This is what many people think of as digitally enabling the sales force. The salesperson wows the buyer with a visually rich and interactive sales experience on his or her tablet. Price isn’t the only factor in the decision. Packaging is one example in the food and beverage arena where visual presentation can go a long way, especially if it’s interactive, allowing the sales person to jointly solution with the customer in real time.</p> <p><strong>Compelling intelligence for competitive products and services</strong><br /> The pitch here is directed at the ROI of a purchase. Visual presentation is still relevant, but what’s critical is data. An example provided by one of our participants is leveraging highly localized sales volume or consumption data to show a food service customer how they could increase sales in a specific location by changing their product mix or swapping brands. The buyer is given a pretty specific forecast of what sales improvements to expect. Again, the ability for the sales person to interactively work with the customer on their tablet is big plus.</p> <p><strong>Compelling deal making for commoditized products and services</strong><br /> In this situation, the sale is almost exclusively about price, and it can be cutthroat. The discussion here centered on private label products that had highly volatile costs due to commodity price fluctuations. Currently, pricing can take days to calculate. Think how powerful it would be if the sales person could accurately prepare a deal to propose, and then run different scenarios in real time with the customer on their tablet. It’s not hard to see how sales volumes would go up (and margins too!) by eliminating the price quoting lag.</p> <p>I expected this to be a fairly straightforward discussion on mobile sales enablement, and it was fascinating how quickly it became very complex. The ideas shared between our IT executives were progressive and enlightening. The key takeaway for me? When contemplating solutions to digitally enable your sales force, it’s critical to define the problem you’re trying to solve. It can lead to radically different solutions. That said, once the right solution is put in place, it can make a huge difference &#8211; opening the door to optimizing the collaborative workflow required <em>inside</em> your organization to successfully complete and fulfill a sale.

<p>Last week, three of the nation’s largest health insurance companies, Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, agreed to work with the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) to develop tools that will offer consumers comprehensive healthcare information. This announcement continues the trend of <a href="h

<![CDATA[
ttp://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/healthcare-cost-transparency/">insurers collaborating with transparency companies</a> – each of whom are vying to gain stronger footholds in the fast growing health care transparency market, which according to a recent report will increase to over $3 billion by 2016.<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p> <p>This HCCI partnership and others like it make sense. Building price and quality transparency tools is a difficult effort, requiring vast amounts of disparate health data, sophisticated technology, and support operations insurers normally cannot provide alone. Whether your company works in collaboration with organizations such as Castlight, HealthSparq, Vitals, or continues to build internally – your company needs a health care transparency “toolbox” to stay on top of an increasingly customer driven and regulated industry. Your strategy should include transparency tools and products driven by customer needs and updated based on usage &#8211; that ultimately help your customers make smarter health care decisions.</p> <p>Your transparency toolbox should include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Network Tools</strong> – Expanded network, coverage, plan, provider, and location searches; direct links to plan benefits; integration with quality tools</li> <li><strong>Quality &amp; Review Tools </strong>– Provider  qualifications; provider industry, colleague, and patient ratings &amp; comparisons; provider clinical or safety metrics &amp; comparisons</li> <li><strong>Price and Treatment Tools </strong>– Easy to find, accurate treatment options, treatment prices, and side-by-side comparison charts; drug pricing and comparison data</li> <li><strong>Cost Calculators</strong> – Total cost of care; out-of-pocket costs; potential cost savings options</li> </ul> <p>Further, make sure to answer these key questions when building your toolbox.</p> <p><strong>Who are your customers? What customer benefits are you providing?</strong><br /> One of the first steps in creating any transparency tool is to assess the customer benefits. Prospects, members, employers, and providers are all looking for unique information for specific purposes. Transparency tools should be tailored to customer utilization and needs. For example, <em>consumers</em> (prospects and members) are paying an increasing percentage of their income to cover health care costs. They are looking for an improved shopping experience with price and quality comparisons. <em>Employers</em> are being asked to cut health care overhead while simultaneously increasing benefits. They are looking for engagement tools, which will help their employees easily find treatment options and determine out-of-pocket costs. <em>Providers </em>want benchmarks and consistent approaches for measuring quality and performance against others. Results can be used to improve services and attract new patients.</p> <p><strong>What information do you have?</strong><br /> Good transparency tools start with even better data. When planning your toolbox strategy, significant time should be spent reviewing available data, from both internal and external sources, and whether the information will produce valuable results to customers. Processes to monitor and report information accuracy and relevancy should also be included as part of a sound data plan.</p> <p><strong>What is your technology?</strong><br /> Should you build internally, with a partner, or both? What tools should be developed first? Toolbox technology decisions greatly affect how fast it can be filled and at what cost. For example, many transparency companies offer both data and technology solutions at the same time. While this may seem like a plus with lower initial costs and a shorter time to market, it often comes with limitations to customization and unending maintenance strings. Conversely, internal development can be slow and costly at the start with long-term maintenance, integration, and benefits coming later. Regardless of who develops the technology, reporting functionality is mandatory. Customer usage and feedback should determine when tools are developed; however, technology decisions need to be considered when prioritizing costs and schedules.</p> <p><strong>How are you encouraging engagement?</strong><br /> Beyond building transparency tools, a parallel effort promoting the toolbox and tool adoption is equally important. For example, tools placed in the purchase path are more likely to have greater usage than standalone instances. Price and quality comparison tools will fare better than rate lists and quality rating icons. Making tools available in multiple formats (desktop, responsive, mobile apps) will also increase engagement. On public pages, allowing customers to share their tool experience on social sites is not only important for driving engagement, but also for establishing your tools as industry essentials.</p> <p>Largely because of the Affordable Care Act, every major health insurance company currently offers some sort of price transparency tool, but it is not enough. As the health care industry continues to become consumer-driven and spending debates at federal and state levels endure, the demand for effective transparency tools has never been higher. And with non-profit and government agencies releasing more and more healthcare data and private organizations, many of which are venture funded, mining this data with new technologies, the ability to develop and improve existing tools has never been easier. While some barriers to building transparency tools exist, such as incongruent data sources, privacy issues, and customer acceptance – these will subside as technology solutions, regulations, and accessibility improve. With financial resources, a wealth of available data, and broad industry reach – health insurers should have no trouble leading the transparency space in the coming years by offering a wide range of tools and products.</p> <hr /> <p><sup id="fn1">1.

<p>You’ve probably heard the adage, “do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” For a Millennial, that falls a little bit short. Not only do we want work to be fulfilling and rewarding, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlmoore/2013/02/28/fun-fun-fun-young-people-want-t

o-have-fun-at-work/" target="_blank">we also want it to be fun</a>. And lest I perpetuate the misconception that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz0o9clVQu8" target="_blank">Millennials are terrible</a> – here’s why that’s a good thing. Creating a work experience that is fun and meaningful is less about entitlement and more about engagement, and that benefits employees of every age. With the NowEnterprise as the <a title="Goodbye Intranet. Say Hello to the NowEnterprise." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">next generation Intranet</a>, it’s possible to meet the needs of the next generation workforce and their desire to make work valuable, satisfying, and, oh yeah – fun.</p> <p>As <a title="The Future of the Knowledge Worker is the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/future-knowledge-worker-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">productivity tools</a> make it possible to work anytime, from anywhere, the line between nine-to-five and five-to-nine is increasingly blurred. If I check-in at my favorite coffee shop while I’m working there, why not check-in at an office hotspot? I want the bragging rights that come with being mayor of the North Conference Room! If Google+ recognizes faces from my circles when I upload pictures, then it only makes sense that the NowEnterprise can identify and tag colleagues when I add photos from our corporate volunteer day. Activity motivators like gamification and social networking make work enjoyable, but more importantly, they can be powerful tools for encouraging participation and driving adoption.</p> <p>Further, if your ultimate goal is to foster critical workplace connections that deliver productivity and bottom-line results, real collaboration isn’t <em>only</em> about sharing expertise and documents. As a die-hard Springsteen fan, one of my first actions within the NowEnterprise was to join the “Jungleland” interest group – the only place where one can “Bruuuuuuuce” with impunity. This interest group provided an introduction to colleagues I never would have encountered in the course of my day-to-day work. When I was placed on a project team with a fellow fan, we had already established a rapport. Skipping the awkward introductions, we were able to hit the ground running. Those few minutes invested in debating “Born to Run” versus “Darkness on the Edge of Town” were returned many times over.</p> <p>To reach your employees now and in the future, it’s essential to make work gratifying and enriching. As <a title="Career Development for Millennials: the NowEnterprise for the Next Generation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/career-development-millennials-nowenterprise-next-generation/" target="_blank">Millennials make up a larger percentage of the workforce</a>, we won’t be talking about fun features as a ‘nice to have’, but as necessary tools for engagement. Because while Millennials do want to have fun, they also expect an enterprise experience that is collaborative, exciting, and meaningful &#8211; in other words, the NowEnterprise.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/millennials-just-want-fun-nowenterprise/">Millennials Just Want to Have Fun (with the NowEnterprise)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>As a health insurer, it can be difficult to stay in touch with your direct members. After all, most people only think about insurance when they need healthcare services, which for many members is only a few times a year.</p> <p>However, one recurring touchpoint that is often overlooked is billing, and specifically online billing. Whether your members pay their premiums monthly, bi-monthly or every six months, billing offers an opportunity to connect with customers, strengthen branding, and build loyalty.</p> <p>At this point, the ability to pay bills online is just table stakes. The customer experience provided by banks and consumer sites like Amazon are the norm, and anything that falls short of those expectations can have negative returns. So how do you build an online billing system that leads to higher customer satisfaction? Let’s talk about the basics. At a minimum, customers should be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Make an immediate one-time payment</li> <li>Schedule a one-time payment in the future</li> <li>Set-up recurring payments</li> <li>Store multiple accounts to their profile</li> <li>View their invoice and payment history</li> <li>Download current and previous invoices</li> </ul> <p>If your system is not able to facilitate these simple tasks, you should stop reading and make them a high priority. If you are hitting all the basics, you’re ready to take online billing to the next level – and the key to elevating online billing from simple transactions to a tool for consumer engagement is great design. Make sure that design is not an after-thought. Ask yourself the questions below:</p> <ul> <li>How intuitive and visually appealing is your site? Can a user figure out how to do what they want to without an instruction guide?</li> <li>Is the billing section clearly identified within the main navigation?</li> <li>Is the amount due displayed prominently, and is navigation logical?</li> <li>Have you done usability testing to see how customers interact with the functionality and identify problem areas?</li> </ul> <p>The final piece of a first-class online billing system is convenience. Today’s customer spends much more time on their mobile device than on their home computer, so it’s critical to adapt. Your site should be responsive, and minimally, render appropriately on mobile devices. In addition, make sure that members are able to select their preferred communication method. As a consumer, I may want to receive invoices via email, but see automated payment notifications via SMS.</p> <p>Your members spend a significant portion of their income on health insurance, and with that comes an expectation of the service levels that industries such as banking and auto insurance routinely provide. Delivering any less will inevitably lead to frustrated customers. However, a functional, well-designed, and convenient online billing system helps to ensure that every interaction consumers have with your company, no matter how infrequent, is a positive one that delivers on your brand promise. You may only have a few opportunities to connect with your existing members – make sure they all count.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/building-loyalty-online-billing/">Building Loyalty with Online Billing</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>For those in Sales, who are often on the road and out of the office, it’s easy to develop a lone wolf mentality. But as <em>The Hangover</em> taught us, we’re better off with our wolf pack. In our ongoing series, we’ve talked about ways in which the NowEnterprise fosters connectivity and co

llaboration, which is essential for <a title="The Future of the Knowledge Worker is the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/future-knowledge-worker-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">knowledge workers</a>, <a title="Career Development for Millennials: the NowEnterprise for the Next Generation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/career-development-millennials-nowenterprise-next-generation/" target="_blank">millennials</a>, and <a title="Don’t Sweat the Annual Review. It’s time for the NowEnterprise." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-sweat-annual-review-time-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">more</a>. This lifeline to the enterprise is even more critical when your ability to deliver a WIN often relies on tapping into the expertise of your colleagues and your company knowledge bases, particularly when you need to be able to work from anywhere. How does the NowEnterprise make the sales process more seamless and effective?</p> <p><strong>Before the Sale</strong><br /> Robust search features and intuitive navigation make it quick and easy to identify the right people to collaborate with and the right information to leverage. Searching by name or subject matter or using a sales specific Line of Business (LOB) application, you can view results by date, expertise, pricing variable and more. Perhaps the go-to expert on a particular detail of a proposal works on the warehouse floor. Equipping deskless workers with mobile devices, the NowEnterprise integrates them into the collaborative proposal process. In addition, past presentation content and LOB resources are searchable and accessible – so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel with each new proposal.</p> <p>Accelerating the process of finding a specific resource during the pre-sale process – whether that is a colleague’s expertise or an accelerating application &#8211; saves time and money, and ultimately, increases your win percentage.</p> <p><strong>On the Road</strong><br /> The NowEnterprise mobile experience is optimized for whatever device you’re working on, letting you work seamlessly across your phone, tablet, and laptop. On a plane or at your desk (for once), robust workflow features simplify the process of reviewing proposals and content, so you can keep the work moving forward wherever you happen to be.</p> <p><strong>During the Sale</strong><br /> Put simply, the NowEnterprise wows clients. An impressive mobile-first, touch and swipe design (that also translates well to a PC) makes an impact in client meetings. The NowEnterprise also enables sales reps to leverage sophisticated “backend” information near real-time while in front of the prospect. This capability becomes a strategic advantage over competitors that are still taking orders and getting back with quotes. The historical quoting process necessitated by an inability to access centrally held critical pricing and availability information slows the process and frustrates customers. Driving a presentation with voice enabled interactions – i.e. next slide, Siri! – is unquestionably more impressive than a clicker. After the meeting, you can create customized client and prospect sites. Instead of emailing a PowerPoint presentation, your leave-behind is a customized microsite that not only includes the meeting documents but integrates outside content like LinkedIn profiles and relevant blog content.</p> <p><strong>After the Sale</strong><br /> We’ve talked before about <a title="Goodbye Intranet. Say Hello to the NowEnterprise." href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">the New Expectation</a> – so what is the new expectation for the Sales process? Like your employees, clients are looking for a remarkable experience. Inspiring proposals and leave-behind content help you stand out from the pack – and drive improved Sales conversions. Strengthening internal buy-in and transparency to opportunities and proposals helps to boost employee engagement. What’s more, empowering your sales team to effectively tap into these internal resources ultimately leads to increased productivity and sales efficiency – and that means lower SG&amp;A costs. The bottom line? Run together, don’t be a pack of one; you’ll enjoy more sales, and more revenue.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/find-wolf-pack-collaborative-sales-nowenterprise/">Find your Wolf Pack: Collaborative Sales with the NowEnterprise</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
as to work really hard to deliver a delightful experience.</p> <p>So why fight this uphill battle? Because your UI says more than you know about who you are as an organization. If properly designed, a polished member portal can turn annoyed members into lifelong customers.</p> <p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when considering user experience and UI design….</p> <p><b>Simple, Clean Navigation</b><br /> You might catch flies with honey, but most people I know prefer a rolled up newspaper. Not the prettiest solution, but it makes quick work of the problem. A simple, clean navigation (while maybe uninspiring) helps your members navigate to where they need to go and complete their task quickly and efficiently. Building an engaging digital experience does not mean getting fancy with navigation. As a general rule of thumb, a member should never need to figure out where to go next. Keep it simple – easy-to-follow navigation tells your members that you are here to help them get on their way.</p> <p><b>Progressive Disclosure</b><br /> Progressive disclosure is not a new concept, but it has a clear place in the world of health insurance. Progressive disclosure distributes content into smaller, more digestible pieces &#8211; showing just enough to get the user down the right path. For the record, progressive disclosure is not a ‘wizard’ pattern. It is difficult to execute because it demands a firm understanding of primary and secondary member tasks. It’s far easier just to include every conceivable link or option on a page and to let the user find their way. Understand why members come to your portal 80% of the time, and design for that experience first and foremost. Progressive disclosure tells your members that you know why they are here.</p> <p><b>Personalized and Dynamic</b><br /> It you want to design an engaging member experience, build a personalized interface that anticipates the member’s needs. If they have never logged in, why not present them with personalized content that helps them understand the features and functions available to them? If they have a recent claim, why not show that information front and center on the home page? This requires a tactful content management strategy, but also entails a user interface that supports dynamic content and panels that can be displayed and hidden without breaking the overall user interface. Personalization is one of the most impactful things you can do. It tells the member that you are speaking directly to them and that they deserve personalized attention.</p> <p>No one wants to use your portal, so let’s accept it and move on. We still owe our members a personalized, clean, and guided user experience. A useful, high-quality user interface demonstrates a commitment to customer service and strengthens your brand promise. And when they consider your portal to be a trusted and valuable resource for managing their health and the health of their family, members will come back.</p> <p>With all that in mind &#8211; what does your member portal say about you?</p> <p><i>This post is part of Tahoe’s series on digital strategy and secure customer/member portals. Up next, we’ll discuss key features and functions, content strategies, and how to make the portal a more strategic tool in an overall digital strategy. Something else you’d like to learn about?

<p>As a health insurer, your secure member portal is one of the primary means for your customers to engage with you digitally. Unfortunately, this experience isn’t always positive. We often hear this consistent refrain from our clients:</p> <ul> <li>“How do we get people to use the portal?”</l
]]>
<![CDATA[
i> <li>“What are the key functions we should focus on and invest in?”</li> <li>“How do we leverage the portal for real customer engagement?”</li> </ul> <p>When we talk about payer member portals at Tahoe Partners, we focus on two core goals: 1) increasing customer loyalty and 2) decreasing payer costs. Done correctly, most member portal initiatives can achieve both these goals simultaneously. Delightful digital customer experiences build trust, improve service, and reduce calls to the customer call center, leading to decreased service costs. What are the keys to achieving these results?</p> <p><b>Simplify the onboarding process to get users into the portal</b>. First, remove the barriers to getting users registered – whether that means auto-registration based on enrollment or a single sign-on through a company intranet, keeping it simple and automated is critical. Make education part of the onboarding process so that members understand the value that the portal provides.</p> <p><b>Provide clear, concise information. </b>Insurance is confusing, and much of what&#8217;s presented on the portal will be complex in both language and concept to most people. Focus on simplifying the information provided and developing interactive visual components. Make sure that material is intuitive to how the USER experiences their insurance – rather than insurer processes. Eliminate insurance jargon whenever possible, and keep terminology in user-based language. Content should be written at the 6<sup>th</sup> grade level, and smart use of video and other multimedia can help to make complicated information digestible. Keep the interface visually clean and avoid clutter that can distract users from focusing on key data.</p> <p><b>Provide accurate data. </b>Nothing is more confusing to the user than mixed messages. Data provided digitally should not contradict data provided in paper format. If the paper-based EOB states that a member may owe $200, the electronic version of that EOB or the claim detail displayed should show the same &#8211; or demonstrate the differences and provide a clear explanation why.</p> <p><b>Personalize the experience.</b> This is one of the rare times that possessing and leveraging user data doesn’t seem creepy. Your members know you know all about them – it’s time to prove it. Personalize content and data based on plan, member type (subscriber vs. dependent), group/individual consumer, on-exchange/off-exchange, gender, health needs and life events. Whenever possible, manage the experience to get smarter based on the actions performed by the user. Take advantage of up-to-date content management tools that enable personalization and marketing/business-based content updates to avoid reliance on IT or a portal “release”. Build in the flexibility required to allow for rapid content changes and dynamic content maintenance.</p> <p><b>Be where your users are.</b> Creating a mobile member portal experience is not optional. This is not a mirror image of the web experience – content should be streamlined, and activities focused around mobile. There should be an option to access the full site, but don’t miss out on the opportunity to tap into the unique characteristics of a smartphone, such as geolocation, in order to improve the user experience.</p> <p><b>Be transparent.</b> Transparency tools are not just an ACA requirement. They help to educate members and create smarter consumers. Make sure your users can answer these questions from your member portal:</p> <ul> <li>Am I covered?</li> <li>How much will this cost?</li> <li>Which providers can I go to? Who is in my network? (But please don’t use the word providers – your members don’t know what exactly that means.)</li> <li>How good is this provider – in terms of both cost and quality?</li> </ul> <p><b>Make it easy to pay</b>. Can you create the Amazon 1-Click experience for your members? Bills must be easy to understand and simple to pay electronically. Enable provider bill pay integration – InstaMed has an option that will allow users to pay providers right off the electronic EOB!</p> <p><b>Know when it’s time to change the channel:</b> When the digital channel can no longer support the member’s needs, make sure that it’s a seamless transition to another channel. If the user does need to make a phone call, the customer service representative on the other end should have as much information as possible about what that user has been doing and what drove the call. Users expect their insurer to know who they are and what they’ve been doing – and to pick up where they left off online.</p> <p>When executed well, improvements in these areas will lead to real results in customer loyalty and call/cost reduction. We’ve seen clients experience numbers as high as <b>59% real call reduction </b>(based on customer surveys) driven by member portal improvements. Are you ready to realize these kinds of gains? Stay tuned over the next few weeks as we take a closer look at these keys to a successful member portal.</p> <p><i>This post is the first in Tahoe’s series on digital strategy and secure customer/member portals. Up next, we’ll discuss customer experience and engagement, key features and functions, content strategies, and how to make the portal a more strategic tool in an overall digital strategy.

<p>Customer engagement isn’t a one-time occurrence, checked off with a cutting-edge customer-facing web portal. Before you spend time and money on a new, enchanting website, first make sure some basic things are in place. Your customers know what they want to achieve by working with you, and fulfilling those needs is critical to delivering the value they expect – both online and off. Do you have the right tools in place, working seamlessly across your organization, to create high-value customer experiences?</p> <p><b>Quality Support Services</b><br /> To impress prospects and maintain your existing customer base, quality support services are essential. Slow service recovery, bad customer service, and unresolved issues are just a few areas within your organization that can detract from your overall brand reputation.</p> <p>Social media lends every consumer a public voice. According to a Mass Relevance survey, among respondents “<i>75% use social media to find or share information about a brand or product. For 18–34 year olds, it’s 91%”. </i>Before you get to “wow” them with your sensational website, you may have already lost them to negative comments and online ratings. When customers do voice their concerns, you have an opportunity to react quickly, apologize and make things right – openly &#8211; when things do go wrong. Having a system in place to learn from those mistakes, prevent them from happening again, and continuously improve your internal support services is vital. In order to stay structured within your organization, internal systems and work management processes need to be accessible, working seamlessly, trained on and adopted by all associates, customer-facing or not.</p> <p>It is no longer true that one particular department is responsible for servicing your customers. It’s a team effort, and cross training is one of the best solutions to improving this area of your business. There are countless critical customer touch points that can be overlooked and not given the proper attention needed to build your brand. Think of those employees on the front line: your accounting department, your sales and marketing team, and more. What systems are in place to provide your customers with a positive experience across all channels? Answer the following questions to see if your organization has the necessary backend quality support services needed to thrive in this ever-changing landscape of high customer demands:</p> <ul> <li>Does your current computer software manage documents and daily processes effectively?</li> <li>Are your customer inquiries handled quickly and consistently? Is this system automated or manual?</li> <li>Are your sales, service, marketing and back office teams efficiently working together? Is communication between departments handled via email or through an internal collaboration system?</li> </ul> <h5 style="text-align: center;">Positive Customer Experiences Start with Quality Support Services</h5> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Quality-Support-Services.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2644" alt="Quality Support Services" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Quality-Support-Services-1024x517.png" width="697" height="351" /></a></p> <p><b>The Solution</b><br /> If you can&#8217;t answer yes to these questions, you’ll have a difficult time meeting the constantly rising expectations of your customers and prospects. Don’t forget that customer-facing employees are your best brand advocates. This means they need the proper tools in place to perform their jobs effectively. Organization-wide collaboration and consistent work management processes help deliver satisfaction and generate loyal customers. After all – it’s not just about attracting new customers, but properly servicing the ones you already have.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/backend-support-critical-successful-frontend-customer-engagement-focus/">To Improve Frontend Customer Engagement, Focus on Backend Support</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Last year we introduced our online <a title="SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment" href="http://www.tahoepartners.com/pages/assessment.aspx" target="_blank">SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment Tool</a> with the simple purpose of helping companies determine whether they should implement or upgrade to SharePoint 2013, and how much benefit they could gain from doing so. We asked simple questions about how important specific collaboration features are to each organization. Since then, we’ve collected a large number of responses. Analyzing these results, we found some interesting trends around traditional uses of SharePoint as well as SharePoint’s future. In this post, we share some of our key findings and invite you to read the entire SharePoint 2013 Assessment Report.</p> <p><strong>I&#8217;d like to learn how others are planning to use SharePoint 2013 &#8211; please send me the report:</strong><br /> [contact-form]</p> <p><b>No Surprise, Companies are using SharePoint for Intranets</b><br /> For those who have been around SharePoint for a number of years, it won&#8217;t be difficult to predict the primary areas where companies said SharePoint 2013 will be important for them. These are some of the tried and true uses of SharePoint – the areas where SharePoint “grew up”, including the top three:</p> <ul> <li>Intranet</li> <li>Collaboration</li> <li>Document Management</li> </ul> <p>A close fourth was Enterprise Search, which is slightly more surprising. While SharePoint has always been considered to improve search functionality for content residing in SharePoint, the significant number of respondents citing Enterprise Search as an important use of SharePoint shows that Microsoft has made progress in this area.</p> <p><b>SharePoint for Internets? Not so much</b><br /> We&#8217;ve noted the areas where companies say SharePoint 2013 will be important &#8211; what about the opposite? The results of the Assessment thus far show that the feature least important to respondents is SharePoint for Internets. Based on other metrics we’ve seen, this isn’t surprising &#8211; but it does illustrate how Microsoft’s efforts to push both SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 as internet platforms are not resonating yet.</p> <p><b>What about the new SharePoint 2013 Features?</b><br /> As we’ve outlined in other posts, SharePoint 2013 introduced significant changes in areas like <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/go-mobile-with-sharepoint-2013-the-top-5-features/">mobile</a>, <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-social-features/">social</a>, and line of business application capabilities. Do companies say these are important areas of SharePoint?</p> <p>Yes and no. While these did not receive the highest rankings, for each of these areas over 60% of the respondents indicated the feature was important or very important. With nearly half of the companies surveyed responding this way, it shows that users are moving beyond traditional uses of SharePoint and expanding into broader collaborative applications. This is what Microsoft was hoping for with the release of SharePoint 2013 &#8211; continued strength in those traditional areas, and growth within collaboration hot spots.</p> <p>These are just some of the conclusions we’ve drawn from the responses. To see the complete results and analysis from the SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment Tool and learn what others hope to do with SharePoint 2013, request the full report:</p> [contact-form] <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-organizations-leverage-strengths-look-future/">SharePoint 2013: Organizations Leverage Strengths, Look to a Hybrid Future</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>As employees, we’ve all been there. It’s December (or June, or whenever performance reviews take place at your organization), and you’re scrambling to put together the self-input portion of your annual evaluation. You want it to accurately capture what you’ve been up to all year &#8211; receiving great feedback from clients and colleagues, pursuing career development goals, delivering world-class solutions. However, those results are not captured in any meaningful, organized way. This makes it difficult to gather and as a result, you’re stuck spending a day sifting through old emails and files instead of actually delivering that outstanding work. For managers, this process is even more cumbersome. Instead of having crucial conversations with our employees about opportunities for growth and career development, we’re spending time reviewing minutiae and checking boxes. For those managers with multiple direct reports, this could take days. The bottom line – if you’re scrambling at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour to fill out a form, chances are it isn’t going to be all that effective.</p> <p>It doesn’t have to be this way &#8211; the NowEnterprise turns managing people into a two-way exchange. Individual employees maintain an Employee Dashboard, where they can track and share private updates specific to their performance goals and objectives. They can proactively manage their progress throughout the year. The goals are right there in front of them daily, and progress toward those goals is tracked on an ongoing basis. So instead of realizing that you are 5 posts short of your “author 20 blog posts” goal with a week to go in the review cycle, you have already exceeded it. Think: more performance management information, in fewer emails.</p> <p>In addition, managing people with the NowEnterprise offers remarkable insight into some of the less tangible aspects of employee performance. It gives you unprecedented visibility into employee activity. You can see who is truly participating in the discussion – engaging with colleagues, sharing knowledge, and fostering a collaborative environment. As a manager, you are able to participate as well. With performance targets top of mind, you can share relevant content with your direct reports to help them accomplish these goals and advance their career development. So you can reward the strong performers and encourage the less active ones in real time – before it is too late.</p> <p>It’s time to make the annual review into something valuable. Better management transparency means less time spent on the busywork of performance management, and improved productivity for both you and your employees. In our previous post on <a title="Career Development for Millennials: the NowEnterprise for the Next Generation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/career-development-millennials-nowenterprise-next-generation/" target="_blank">Career Development with the NowEnterprise</a>, we noted that engaged employees with a clear career path in place tend to perform better and to stay with their employer. This is another piece of that puzzle. With the NowEnterprise, performance management becomes an effective tool to boost engagement and retention by enabling real growth and career development opportunities. Let’s send the typical review the way of typewriters and the three martini lunch – besides, we prefer microbrews. It’s time to embrace the new standard of performance management with the NowEnterprise.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-sweat-annual-review-time-nowenterprise/">Don’t Sweat the Annual Review.

<p>What are Millennials looking for in their careers? <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140122180239-27058877-what-millennials-want-and-why-employers-should-take-notice?trk=eml-ced-b-art-M-1&amp;ut=0l_4EaGtXqJ641" target="_blank">Research shows</a> they want to work for organizations that value innovation and foster creativity – where imagination and outside-the-box thinking are rewarded. Although they are actively seeking opportunities for career development, above all, they want the option to chart their own course. Over the next 10 years, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/09/04/why-you-cant-ignore-millennials/" target="_blank">Millennials will come to make up more than three quarters of the workforce</a>, yet many companies are not meeting this fundamental need &#8211; 75% of Millennials believe their organizations could do more to develop future leaders.</p> <p>Let me introduce you to Claire. A true Millennial, she doesn’t hesitate to change jobs in pursuit of advancement in her Supply Chain career. Now that she’s a Logistics Manager at an organization that shares her values, she’d like to stay put – here’s how the NowEnterprise helps her do that.</p> <p>With the NowEnterprise, Claire takes an active role in her career development, all managed through her personal career profile. Each day, she reviews her feeds on her Careers Dashboard – think Twitter and Flipboard for the Enterprise. She follows several senior people within her company with skills similar to her own, as well as several external industry experts, incorporated into the NowEnterprise through blog posts and social media. In addition, she belongs to several career-related Groups, both internal and external, integrated into her Careers Dashboard through her LinkedIn profile.</p> <p>As she peruses her feed, Claire sees a new event hosted by the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals &#8211; a webinar on sustainability practices, a hot topic for Supply Chain professionals. She adds it to her Career Calendar, a self-managed training program that seamlessly combines a company-provided training plan with online classes, conferences, and other opportunities for continuing education. Taking note of this emerging topic, she creates a new category on her virtual pinboard for sustainability. As she starts to gather related content, she can collect it all here – blog posts, articles by industry experts, internal documents, and more.</p> <p>Later that day, someone else in the company posts a request for knowledge on sustainability. Quickly referring to her pinboard, she responds to the request with an article she found earlier that day. Observing that there is interest beyond her own team, she authors a POV on the subject, and posts it to her company’s corporate news under Emerging Trends. By the end of the day, the individual who posted the initial request for information has begun following her, as well as many other colleagues who read her article.</p> <p>As she curates relevant content and fosters these valuable connections, Claire is able to take all of this along with her as she moves upwards through the organization. Leveraging the NowEnterprise to manage her career development, she is able to identify and advance her skills, all the while making herself more visible within the company.</p> <p>As for Claire’s employer, they have realized improvements in the long-term performance of their workforce and in their ability to retain their top talent. Giving their employees the opportunity to direct their own career development – in a way that is highly visible and familiar to use – has been a win-win. The bottom line? They can better identify and reward top performers and internal experts. Engaged employees who feel that they are on a path to the next step in their career tend to do better work – and to stick around.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/career-development-millennials-nowenterprise-next-generation/">Career Development for Millennials: the NowEnterprise for the Next Generation</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>When trying to understand the customer experience of a product or service, it can be helpful to take a meaningful look at the larger context a user inhabits. Is this person going through events in his or her life – either planned or unplanned – that are the driving force for their actions? Many products and services are means to another end &#8211; understanding what the user is really trying to accomplish can uncover unmet needs and provide opportunities to connect, serve, and even delight.</p> <p>We often define “moments of truth” as distinct interactions a company has with a customer. The larger context of a life event includes those moments, as well as the related emotional and psychological components surrounding those touchpoints.</p> <p>Recently, Health Care Service Corporation looked at an unexpected job loss as a life event that could uncover opportunities to better connect with members during a difficult time in their lives. While everyone gets through the experience of job loss differently – some people bounce back from this setback fairly quickly, while others take longer to recover – almost everyone can use help understanding their health insurance options. Based on the insights we gleaned from our research, we were able to create more empathic messages to connect with people in this situation, identifying gaps in our experience and tactics to fill them, and delivering a cross-channel strategy to proactively target people who had recently lost their jobs.</p> <p>What can health insurers take away from our experience? If you have been tasked with improving customer experience, uncovering new opportunities to connect with your consumers is an excellent start.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/insurers-uncover-opportunities-connect/">Insurers: Uncover Opportunities to Connect</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent post, we considered how providing cost, context, and advice to insured members leads to a best-in-class <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/?p=2175">healthcare cost transparency experience</a> &#8211; and in the process, uncovered some common obstacles that make better member servi

ce seem like a significant challenge. Wondering where to start? If you are a payer or provider looking to improve member service, take a look at our short list of recommendations for better customer service:</p> <p><b>Make it easy for members to find a doctor</b><br /> A majority of consumers find their general physician through family or friends, or by perusing independent review sites like Healthgrades.com and Yelp. According to a recent patient survey by <a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/medical/industryview/how-patients-use-online-reviews/">SoftwareAdvice</a>, these are the two most popular websites used by patients in their doctor search process – in spite of the fact that most payers and even many providers have a ‘find a doctor’ tool. This tool should be a major feature on the home page, not buried within links, or worse, after a login. Give users an easy-to-find, straightforward provider search tool on your public site home page that both shoppers and members can use.</p> <p><b>Provide members with a checklist to prepare for doctor visits</b><br /> Help improve efficiency by advising members what to do, what to bring, and what questions to ask <i>before</i> their appointment. For example, it is common practice for adult patients to fast prior to their annual physical appointment so that blood draws for lab tests can be performed. Providers we spoke with shared that at least half their patients forget to fast before this visit. Some providers make it a part of their practice to reach out to patients when scheduling and confirming appointments with a short pre-visit to-do list. Here is an opportunity for payers to step in and provide members with tools to make these visits more productive – with the added benefit of reducing time and unnecessary costs associated with re-scheduled appointments.</p> <p><b>Reduce the amount of administrative work for providers (&amp; payers)</b><br /> I can hear providers cheering in the background now…. Jokes aside, payers should continue to explore ways to create process efficiencies that allow providers to spend more time providing care to patients and less time acting as an ad hoc benefits office. This might mean providing both members and providers a one-page guide to their Top 10 medical coverage benefits or a quick reference on member costs for copays and deductible balances. Further, payers can enhance provider portals with robust online search capabilities to easily find coverage details, forms and complete online form submissions.</p> <p><b>Give providers accurate and up-to-date information</b><br /> Providers regularly refer patients to specialists and other healthcare services. At times, these referrals lead to providers who no longer accept their patient’s insurance – a bad patient experience for all parties involved. This can be avoided if providers have a process in place when insurance coverage changes. It may be as simple as updating the provider site to show a <i>current</i> list of plans accepted. Payers can enhance their provider portals to make up-to-date information easily accessible by leveraging their current ‘find a doctor’ search tool used by members.</p> <p><b>Encourage members to use their general practitioner</b><br /> Thanks to a plethora of health-related sites such as WebMD, providers are seeing a huge uptick in patients self-diagnosing and making appointments directly with a specialist, bypassing their primary doctor. This sometimes results in costly specialist appointments that could have been avoided. Insurers can cultivate their online member portal as a trusted resource where members turn to learn more about a health issue &#8211; one where the principal call to action is scheduling an appointment with a primary doctor. Further, as providers develop more online health assets for their patients, they can guide patients to first meet with their primary doctor.</p> <p>As short as this checklist is, some of these items are no easy task – current budgets notwithstanding. Payers and providers should challenge themselves to find some quick wins. Don’t be surprised when this list easily aligns with current company goals. Which of these items would you like to check off for 2014?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/payer-provider-checklist-better-customer-service/">A Payer-Provider Checklist for Better Customer Service</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

examined how the NowEnterprise impacts specific roles, such as <a title="Project Management: On-time and On-budget with the NowEnterprise" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/project-management-on-time-and-on-budget-with-the-nowenterprise/" target="_blank">project manager</a>, and functions, like <a title="Collaborative Selling with the NowEnterprise: A Future Focused on Your Customers" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/collaborative-selling-nowenterprise-future-focused-customers/" target="_blank">collaborative selling</a>. But what does this future state NowEnterprise look like for the typical information worker?</p> <p>According to <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/boosting_the_productivity_of_knowledge_workers">McKinsey research</a>, knowledge workers spend more than half their workday on “interactions” – with customers, vendors, and other employees. These efforts are indispensable but sometimes difficult to measure. Unlike an assembly line, where efficiency is counted in speed and output, an information worker’s daily tasks tend to be more varied. Improved productivity is found incrementally, and sometimes found outside the office.</p> <p>That is where the NowEnterprise stands out. It can revolutionize the day-to-day efforts of a knowledge worker, by making the most of their time and untethering them from their desks. For example:</p> <p><em><strong>Status Quo</strong></em><br /> <em> I arrive at work in the morning and spend first 45 minutes of the day sorting through emails.</em></p> <p><em><strong>With the NowEnterprise</strong></em><br /> <em> I arrive at work in the morning and log in to the NowEnterprise. I find a list of critical tasks – culled from open requests, calendar items, and the occasional email – and start tackling them in order of priority.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Status Quo</strong></em><br /> <em> I use multiple tools to get my job done, but everything is separate. I spend a lot of unproductive time switching between applications and trying to find information.</em></p> <p><em><strong>With the NowEnterprise</strong></em><br /> <em> All the tools and information I need are available right in the NowEnterprise. I can see my calendar, important tasks, social interactions, and complete my time sheet without jumping between applications.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Status Quo</strong></em><br /> <em> Most interactions are conducted through email – and sometimes things get lost in the shuffle.</em></p> <p><em><strong>With the NowEnterprise</strong></em><br /> <em> Requests from customers and colleagues and items requiring my approval are seamlessly integrated into my “home base” – the NowEnterprise.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Status Quo</strong></em><br /> <em> My kids have an afternoon dentist appointment. I take the afternoon off to pick them up from school and drive them, and kill time reading a People magazine in the waiting room.</em></p> <p><em><strong>With the NowEnterprise</strong></em><br /> <em> With the NowEnterprise, I can work from anywhere. While the kids get their teeth cleaned, I am able to log on with my tablet and pick up right where I left off at my desk.</em></p> <p>The NowEnterprise offers unprecedented flexibility for information workers, while driving major improvements in individual efficiency – and that’s good for both employees and employers. When workers are empowered to do their job effectively, not only are they able to excel, but they are more likely to stick around. Organizations at the forefront of the NowEnterprise will likely find themselves with a more productive, highly satisfied workforce.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/future-knowledge-worker-nowenterprise/">The Future of the Knowledge Worker is the NowEnterprise</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>As a project manager, productivity is essential – both my own and that of my team. But what that looks like depends on the day. It might be found in time saved by eliminating the usual flood of status update emails, or it could mean connecting with the right people at the right time, whether virtually or in person. As part of <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/">our ongoing series</a>, we’re looking at how employees use the NowEnterprise in their work roles. This is one project manager’s story:</p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>I manage a great group of smart, creative people, but like many large teams spread across multiple locations, working cohesively can be a challenge. Gathering everyone in a single location can be a logistical nightmare, and I hate an endless stream of mass emails. Recently, while walking back to my office after lunch, I ran into one of my team members. She usually works remotely, but was in the Chicago office for the week. We started chatting, and our impromptu conversation evolved into something more closely resembling a meeting. With the NowEnterprise, it’s easy to capitalize on opportunities like this. I had my Surface tablet with me, so I instantly created a new meeting and tagged it with our project name. In a few clicks, I was able to book an available conference room and post a note to the team site’s social feed inviting any available project team members to come join us – onsite or through an online meeting.</em></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>The NowEnterprise is always running on my tablet, and it has become an integral part of my project management role. At this particular meeting, I asked a question outside the skill set of the group gathered in the room. Matching key words from my question with tags in social profiles, the NowEnterprise suggested a subject matter expert to consult and pulled her in for a quick video chat, giving us an instant answer and eliminating the need for additional offline work.</em></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>What about those who weren’t able to join us for an unscheduled meeting – how do we keep them in the loop? Through the NowEnterprise, I created an audio recording, automatically transcribing notes from the session and generating a list of follow-up tasks for me to approve and assign to team members and other stakeholders in a seamless workflow. The output of our impromptu meeting integrates painlessly into our project collaboration workspace. Everyone has access – without exchanging a single email.</em></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>I don’t think of the NowEnterprise as an intranet anymore, it’s just my home base for work. Since it launched, we are completing more projects on-time and on-budget. But what I value even more than the end result is how it helps our team members (me included) make better use of our time. Since we’re not searching for documents, exchanging emails, and bird-dogging approvals, we’re freed up to truly innovate and collaborate – which, after all, is the whole point.</em></span></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/project-management-on-time-and-on-budget-with-the-nowenterprise/">Project Management: On-time and On-budget with the NowEnterprise</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

, we thought a new series on the topic was in order. In this post, we’ll look at the concept of Self-Service BI, as well as Microsoft&#8217;s vision of enabling the information worker.</p> <p><b>Self-Service BI</b><br /> The resources and tools commonly used to provide analytical data for decision makers are typically owned and maintained by IT. These tools can be difficult to manage, and time-consuming to produce actionable reports, even for the simplest of BI requests. Self-Service BI aims to strike a balance between the needs of the business (rapid access to information) and that of IT (governance and control of data).</p> <p>Gartner defines <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/self-service-business-intelligence">Self-Service BI</a> as “end users designing and deploying their own reports and analyses within an approved and supported architecture and tools portfolio.” The key here is to provide the managed<a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Self-Service-BI.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2330 alignright" alt="Microsoft Self-Service BI" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Self-Service-BI-291x300.jpg" width="262" height="270" /></a> infrastructure that empowers <i>Information Workers, IT Pros </i>and<i> Data Stewards</i> in order to quickly:</p> <ul> <li><b><i>Discover</i></b> data from internal and external sources using familiar processes</li> <li>Transform and <b><i>Mash up</i></b> the data with other sources to create meaningful, action-provoking reports</li> <li><b><i>Analyze</i></b> data in various dimensions to <b><i>Visualize</i></b> hidden insights out of chunks of data</li> <li>Allow them to<b><i> </i></b>easily<b><i> Share</i></b> insights with others</li> </ul> <p>Gartner asserts that “by 2015, organizations integrating high-value, diverse, new information types and sources into a coherent information management infrastructure will outperform their industry peers financially by more than 20%.” McKinsey agrees, confirming that organizations that use data and business analytics to drive decision-making are more productive and deliver higher return on equity than those who don’t.</p> <p><b>Power BI for Office 365</b><br /> Microsoft Power BI for Office 365 is a self-service business intelligence (BI) solution, delivered through Excel and Office 365, providing information workers with data analysis and visualization capabilities to identify deeper business insights on-premises or within a trusted cloud environment. With Power BI for Office 365, customers can connect to data in the cloud, or extend their existing on-premises data sources and systems to quickly build and deploy self-service BI solutions hosted in Microsoft’s enterprise cloud.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Self-Service-BI-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2304" alt="Self-Service BI" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Self-Service-BI-2.png" width="682" height="320" /></a></p> <p>But what is it really? Power BI isn’t a single feature, but an array of Excel 2013 capabilities combined with the power of Office 365 applications. On the Excel 2013 client side, Power BI is surfaced through the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/office365-sharepoint-online-enterprise-help/power-bi-getting-started-guide-HA104103589.aspx#_Power_Query">Power Query</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/office365-sharepoint-online-enterprise-help/power-bi-getting-started-guide-HA104103589.aspx#_Power_Pivot">Power Pivot</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/office365-sharepoint-online-enterprise-help/power-bi-getting-started-guide-HA104103589.aspx#_Power_View">Power View</a>, and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/office365-sharepoint-online-enterprise-help/power-bi-getting-started-guide-HA104103589.aspx#_Power_Map">Power Map</a> capabilities. Within the Office 365 cloud, Power BI components are extended via <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/office365-sharepoint-online-enterprise-help/power-bi-getting-started-guide-HA104103589.aspx#_Power_BI_Sites">Power BI Sites</a>. Together, Microsoft has created a self-service experience that the end-user can quickly leverage to get the insights they need.</p> <p>Want to experience Power BI for yourself?

harePoint governance initiative.</p> <p>Leveraging the combined strengths of Tahoe Partners and our partner firm <a href="https://twitter.com/avepoint_inc" target="_blank">AvePoint</a>, we approach the challenges associated with governance from a holistic standpoint. Good governance addresses the complete environment in which the workforce is operating:</p> <ul> <li>Business processes</li> <li>Information and data</li> <li>Applications and infrastructure</li> <li>People (inside and outside of the organization) and culture</li> </ul> <p>In a perfect world, we would begin to address governance at the point we develop the Collaboration/Engagement Strategy and Roadmap, and operationalize it as we deploy the SharePoint platform and associated business initiatives.</p> <p>Of course, best case scenarios are typically the exception, not the rule! From a practical perspective, we’ve created a comprehensive view that utilizes Tahoe’s knowledge of the attributes that drive effective governance from the enterprise and solution-specific level, along with AvePoint’s expertise and enabling technology.</p> <p>Effective governance is a multi-step process of <i>identification and compliance. </i>Together, we address governance from a top-down and/or bottom-up approach. Regardless of where we enter into the governance maturity life-cycle of a particular organization, we can move up or down the ladder of continuity to ensure success and adoption. Just as importantly, we can identify where those elements can be automated within AvePoint&#8217;s product suite. Further, the softer issues associated with the deployment of a governance program, such as culture and communication, must also be addressed.</p> <p>This combined approach from Tahoe and AvePoint eliminates potential issues that sometimes occur between strategy, design, and execution &#8211; we have taken the awkward hand-off between business solutions and infrastructure out of the equation. This comprehensive approach provides us with multiple benefits:</p> <ul> <li>Establishes a continuous learning environment that improves governance within the specific organization, as well as the overall set of dimensions that we utilize on an ongoing basis</li> <li>Extends the value of the AvePoint product set by providing continuing insights into the elements necessary to manage governance across the enterprise and point specific solutions</li> </ul> <p>The primary objectives of governance and compliance are to protect the interests of the enterprise while simultaneously creating an environment of confidence that drives adoption, productivity and innovation. In short, a balance of the art and science of governance.</p> <p>The level of engagement and interest in complex topics like this has been a highlight of #SPC14. I look forward to meeting more of you – before we wrap up today, stop by and see us at Booth #234!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/live-spc14-part-3/">Live from #SPC14: Part 3</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Keeping with the theme of highlighting conversations from Microsoft #SPC14, one significant question that comes up a lot is that of how organizations can empower end users while ensuring adherence to governance policies.</p> <p>This is a great question… one that we have discussed with conference participants, as well as our partners <a href="https://twitter.com/AvePoint_Inc" target="_blank">AvePoint</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KodakDI" target="_blank">Kodak Alaris</a>. From my perspective, tackling the challenge of governance is a difficult balance of art and science. Typically, an organization is trying to achieve multiple goals:</p> <ul> <li>Increase effectiveness and efficiency in day-to-day activities</li> <li>Drive innovation through collaboration and improved access to people and information</li> <li>Increase collaboration by generating excitement and boosting adoption</li> <li>Protect their interests and competitive advantage through compliance and appropriate governance policies</li> </ul> <p>I think it’s time to reframe the conversation. Governance is typically associated with rules and regulations. To most people, that means restricting what they can and cannot do &#8211; often perceived as a negative. We need to build a strong association between governance and confidence.</p> <p>Confidence is that elusive state that drives adoption and collaboration. If I am confident in the people I interact with, the information and insights that I have access to, and the boundaries I am operating in, I will feel safe in the environment. I will feel confident – a confidence that drives adoption, use, productivity, and innovation. That positive governance environment is what we want to create and work within.</p> <p>Once we’ve changed the way we talk about governance to reflect how, when done well, it empowers people and organizations to be successful – it’s time to discuss how to manage compliance.</p> <p>Without compliance, governance becomes a worthless exercise, producing the inevitable big, bound manual that sits on a shelf. Adherence to governance policies must become second nature – operating behind the curtain without in-your-face barriers. To me, this means education and automation through such tools as <a href="https://twitter.com/AvePoint_Inc">AvePoint’s</a> DocAve Governance Automation and Compliance Guardian.</p> <p>The keys to governance success: widespread buy-in to the policies that protect the organization and drive user confidence – all in an automated fashion. That is the balance of art and science!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/insights-spc14-part-2/">Insights from #SPC14: Part 2</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>It is early into the SharePoint Conference and all indications point to another successful event!</p> <p>Working Tahoe&#8217;s exhibit booth (#234), I am excited to talk to conference participants – ranging from senior business and IT executives to SharePoint architect and development professionals. We&#8217;re hearing many attendees asking similar questions, and some common themes are already emerging. One prominent question we hear: what are some ways organizations can ensure SharePoint meets the needs of the business?</p> <p>Based on real-world experiences with our clients, there are a number of critical items that organizations must consider before they can realize SharePoint’s most powerful benefits. Companies must acknowledge and accept the fact that today’s workforce expects more from their technology:</p> <ul> <li>To always be connected</li> <li>To be allowed the freedom of mobility</li> <li>To experience an environment that they enjoy</li> </ul> <p>Once an organization embraces this new paradigm, SharePoint becomes much more than a user productivity tool – it becomes the enterprise platform for changing the way people collaborate and perform their day-to-day business. In addition to its inherent capabilities and features, SharePoint is the right platform for:</p> <ul> <li>Combining structured, unstructured, and social data</li> <li>Redefining business processes from transactional to collaborative efforts</li> <li>Eliminating organizational barriers and accessing the right people and information from across the enterprise to drive innovation, improve productivity, and positively impact bottom line performance</li> </ul> <p>To ensure that SharePoint meets the needs of the business, and becomes that enterprise platform, organizations must:</p> <ul> <li>Develop an appropriate strategy and roadmap – one that aligns itself with the goals and objectives of the business, and is continuously refined to reflect changing conditions and priorities</li> <li>Outline a corresponding governance strategy – one that addresses the business processes, the information, and the technologies (SharePoint and others)</li> <li>Craft an appropriate user experience strategy to match the expectations of the user base, generating the momentum and excitement needed to drive success</li> <li>Plan an appropriate adoption strategy to bring everything together – usability drives adoption, and adoption drives innovation and productivity</li> </ul> <p>For many of our clients, SharePoint is at a crucial point in the maturity lifecycle. It started out as a user-productivity tool, gained some excitement, and now has grown out of control, manifest in issues such as:</p> <ul> <li>Redundant or corrupt data throughout the environment</li> <li>Mismanaged sites across organizational units, departments, and even teams</li> <li>Security and compliance issues around every corner</li> <li>Poor adoption rates</li> <li>Users abandoning the platform because of loss of confidence</li> </ul> <p>Spending this week at SharePoint Conference, I am constantly reminded of how important it is to get back to the basics:</p> <ul> <li>A defined strategy and roadmap – with specific initiatives (scoped in reasonable timeframes that demonstrate progress and benefit on a continuous basis) that move the organization from current-state to a desired future state</li> <li>A strong governance policy – providing appropriate freedom without creating bigger issues for the company</li> <li>An automated compliance method – not only keeping things in check, but also creating a learning environment so the organization can grow and refine as they mature in this new way of collaborating and performing work</li> </ul> <p>The journey won’t be easy but the ship has sailed – there are lots of great examples of how and how not to navigate down the path to real collaboration.</p> <p>More from Vegas as time permits!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/real-time-insights-spc14/">Real-time Insights from #SPC14</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>While the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period is ending on March 31, the Medicaid expansion portion of the law for low-income families is just gaining momentum. According to the CMS, Medicare enrollment numbers between October 1 and December 31, 2013 topped 6.3 million. With billions in federal dollars earmarked over the next decade for states that create or expand Medicaid or ‘dual eligible’ Medicare-Medicaid programs, sign ups are projected to keep rising. Insurance companies should act now to secure state contracts in the expanding Medicare/Medicaid market.</p> <p>Since the Supreme Court decision allowing state lawmakers to opt out of ACA’s Medicaid expansion, 25 states have decided to move forward. Many others are still debating the issue, citing long-term costs as the chief concern. However, new tax revenue and employment growth should offset this burden. Insurers stand to gain from ACA mandates that expand Medicaid coverage for individuals earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line, or roughly $31,800 for a family of four, who are now required to obtain benefit coverage through private plans. More states are likely to participate over the next three years, while the federal government will pay 100% of the costs &#8211; with the majority of revenue split between hospitals and insurance providers. The federal contribution gradually decreases to 90% by 2020, in contrast with pre-ACA Medicaid costs split 50/50 between the federal government and the states.</p> <p>Insurance companies who are effective in catering to new Medicaid audiences and facilitate stable programs to maintain costs should see positive membership, market share, hiring, and revenue growth. <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/29/4-insurers-benefiting-from-medicaid-reform.aspx">According to a recent Motley Fool post</a>, UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Molina Healthcare, and Centene are all expecting gains over the next three years, in part due to a greater number of state contracts to provide Medicaid benefits and services.</p> <p>What can insurers do to achieve success in this new environment?</p> <ul> <li><strong>Work with states.</strong> Monitor state healthcare reform and Medicaid initiatives and requests for proposals. Encourage health departments and legislators to adopt consistent review guidelines, waiver adoption, enrollment, payment, and technical requirements.</li> <li><strong>Establish uniform practices across markets.</strong> Under ACA, states (through insurance providers) need to provide minimum health benefits and follow strict marketing guidelines and review regulations. Companies who can deliver benefits steadily across all Medicaid programs through common business, legal, and technology standards will have an advantage over those who adopt one-off approaches.</li> <li><strong>Embrace supplemental benefits.</strong> Because pre-enrollment advertising is often not allowed, emphasize complimentary programs that encourage use of member services like wellness initiatives or transportation assistance. Monitor competitors and experiment with “extras” to determine what works to drive member engagement and renewals.</li> <li><strong>Establish strong pharmaceutical relationships and expand provider network.</strong> Medicaid audiences cast a wide net, and often require new drugs and specialized care. Insurance companies need to reexamine pharmacy policies and provider agreements to make sure benefits and services cover behavioral and mental health, transportation, rehab, and managed care arrangements.</li> <li><strong>Community outreach &amp; advocacy.</strong> States are looking for insurance providers to take an active role in collaborating with community groups to educate Medicaid audiences. Creating events and inviting advocate groups to participate may lead to strong government partnerships down the road.</li> <li><strong>Website &amp; accessibility.</strong> Medicaid audiences are generally from lower-income households, and other demographic and disability factors can vary greatly. Because of these differences, the companies that create a wide range of ways to reach members will find the most success. Beyond website and call centers, mobile sites, multi-language, and accessibility services for the hearing or visually impaired are also required.</li> </ul> <p>Insurance companies will need to balance the cost of building these workstreams up front with initiatives they can tackle as membership grows, or provide as a la carte features. Consumer advisory panels, feedback surveys, and usability studies will also help in prioritizing what consumers use, and where dollars are best spent.</p> <p>According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the federal government initially set aside approximately $800 billion for Medicaid expansion between 2013 and 2022. With only 25 states and the District of Columbia currently participating, it is reasonable to assume not all of it will be doled out. We expect to see those states that have opted-in going after as much of what’s left over as possible, and insurers who go along for the ride will prosper. Those who do not may be wishing they had.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/insurance-companies-leaving-billions-table/">Are Insurance Companies Leaving Billions on the Table?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s SharePoint Conference 2014 is less than two weeks away!</p> <p>Like most shows of this magnitude, the value you receive from it is directly proportional to the energy and focus you put into it. In a previous post, Alex Gasick highlighted what we believe will be <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-conference-2014/">this year’s hot topics</a>. As always, there will be a wealth of information available; the key to ‘soaking up’ the right information is to come prepared for the show. Prioritize what’s relevant to you and work your way down your list.</p> <p>Whether you are a business or IT executive, solution developer, or IT infrastructure professional, the conference provides multiple tracks to help you advance your knowledge of all things SharePoint.</p> <p>An excited group of sponsors and exhibitors will be on display to answer questions, demonstrate solutions, and help to create an even more enjoyable, beneficial experience.</p> <p>We certainly hope you will stop by our booth (Tahoe Partners: Booth #234), introduce yourself and take advantage of our knowledge and expertise. With our mission of radically changing the way people engage and collaborate, we would love the opportunity to discuss how the expectations of today’s workforce are changing the way day-to-day business is performed &#8211; <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/">we call it the NowEnterprise</a>. We are also excited to talk practical approaches and solutions to such areas of focus as collaborative strategies, architecture, governance, user-centric design, and business critical line-of-business (LOB) solution development and deployment.</p> <p>Our business partners will also be present to discuss how their specific offerings enable and extend the benefits of the collaborative solutions we at Tahoe develop and deploy. Our partner AvePoint (Booth #2214) is a proven software leader that provides enterprise class governance, compliance, and management solutions for social enterprise collaborative platforms. Kodak Alaris, with its Document Imaging solutions, enables our SharePoint based LOB solutions by capturing and consolidating data from digital and paper sources, extracting valuable insights from the content, and delivering the right information to the right people at the right time.</p> <p>Whatever your area of focus, SPC14 offers significant value to everyone with an interest in SharePoint. Lots to see, lots to learn &#8211; plan the work, work the plan!</p> <p>See you in Las Vegas!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/making-microsoft-spc14/">Making the Most of Microsoft #SPC14</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone whose responsibilities include SharePoint as an enterprise platform can appreciate it when the business is willing to invest in it. Let’s face it &#8211; it’s not the easiest to go to bat for in budget meetings. When prodded for a business case, we often find ourselves trying to articu
]]>
<![CDATA[
late a lot of intangibles that are difficult to quantify. I’ve walked away from many budget meetings with nothing but the not-so-comforting mantra of: well, maybe next year. So when a solid business need helps drive a SharePoint investment, we need to make it count.</p> <p>But many of us allow, or are victim to, the platform becoming old and stale. So when it’s time to finally show SharePoint some love, what new capabilities will ride shotgun with the primary business driver? A version upgrade? A new Intranet design? If you’re like us, you’ve been accumulating a SharePoint wish list for some time.</p> <p>In my most recent experience, it was Document Management that brought SharePoint back to the operating table. But, wait. To get the Document Management features we need, we’ll need to first upgrade from our current version. And if we’re going to draw people to our new Document Management platform, we should help drive user adoption by repositioning our SharePoint environment to be the Intranet that we know it can be. Further, if we’re going to avoid SharePoint deterioration, we’ll need a strong governance model. Oh, and a division of Legal also wants to know if we can develop some basic Contract Lifecycle Management capabilities on SharePoint. When can they have it? Hmm….let’s come back to that. And let’s not forget all the change management needed along the way.</p> <p>Ok, so we have our list of requirements, right? Well, maybe those are projects. Yeah, that’s it. Projects that make up a program. So we just need to cost out those projects and we’ll have our budgetary numbers.</p> <p>So we did the natural thing. We started talking to potential partners that could help us execute against our collection of aspirations. We asked questions like: “How would you go about collecting requirements from the stakeholders?” And then: “How much would it cost to implement those requirements?”</p> <p>Yeah, I know. It sounded just as stupid then as it does now.</p> <p>As our own questions echoed back to us, it became apparent that we needed to construct a strategy before we started talking about long-term funding much less executing anything. This was not an easy decision, partially because we had this pent-up desire to jump straight into improving things. But also because we were expected to come back to the business relatively quickly with an informed request for funding. There were just too many unanswered questions. We had a laundry list of projects and ideas (they were too high level to be called “requirements”) but we simply didn’t know enough to effectively put a cohesive plan together to which you could apply a budget with any accuracy.</p> <p>We decided to go back to the business and explain our recommendation to conduct an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy Assessment. At the core of this assessment &#8211; and absolutely essential &#8211; were structured interviews of all key stakeholders and subject matter experts. In the end, we would have a comprehensive set of requirements rolled up into an enterprise roadmap, and budgetary estimates for each step of the journey.</p> <p>To be honest, business leadership showed some uncertainty when we explained our intention to delay execution planning until after we put together a well-constructed strategy. But it quickly became a recommendation very easy to defend as it just resonated as common sense. The reality is that we would be funding this work as part of an initial program phase anyway. But trying to determine costs or even a plan beyond the assessment would have been a dangerous shot in the dark. Now, we have no long-term commitment beyond the assessment. In fact, we now have a roadmap from which we can use to selectively choose which step we want to take next and when. Not to mention we have a substantial collection of requirements that serve as valuable input into each project on our roadmap.</p> <p>I should say that timing did play a part here. In our case, we found enough funds in the current year to fund the Strategy Assessment and complete it in time to know how much we needed to budget for the following year… execution year. And, since I now have a roadmap complete with project phases on a timeline, I have an effective communication tool that I can use to set proper expectations with business stakeholders – like the Legal division requesting CLM capabilities.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-ready-fire-aim/">No Enterprise Collaboration Strategy?

<![CDATA[
<p>Many health insurers are partnering with providers and transparency companies like <a title="Castlight Health" href="http://www.castlighthealth.com/" target="_blank">Castlight</a>, <a title="HealthSparq" href="http://www.healthsparq.com/" target="_blank">HealthSparq</a>, and <a title="Vitals" href="http://www.vitals.com/" target="_blank">Vitals</a> to deliver on consumer (and government) demands to be more open about the cost of care. If you’re among the payers and providers working to tackle transparency, rest assured that your efforts are worthwhile – as the health insurance landscape flattens, those who do transparency well will stand out from the pack.</p> <p>Here are three insights that may help inform your approach:</p> <p><strong>Transparency is more than just costs</strong> – it also means providing information that can be easily understood. Even as “Health Insurance 101” classes, videos and other resources gain popularity, consumers are still confused by common coverage terms: out-of-pocket maximum, coinsurance, and deductible. How can consumers be expected to use their insurance effectively if they don’t understand the insurance lingo?</p> <p>Educate consumers with a simple pre-boarding process so that they know what to expect from your health plan, and facilitate an engaging onboarding process to help these new and renewing members effectively use their coverage.</p> <p><strong>Transparency also refers to the need for context.</strong> Don’t just tell me the cost for a physical therapy session at a given facility. Also tell me:</p> <ul> <li>It will cost $200 to cover the 10 physical therapy sessions recommended by my doctor, including the $50 remaining on my deductible for the year.</li> <li>This facility I selected has an average 4.4 out of 5 star patient rating. Show me patient reviews, and a list of recommended physical therapists and their patient ratings.</li> <li>An office with an average 4.9 star rating is 5 minutes closer to home and will cost $250, $50 more than the facility above. Provide a link and help me switch.</li> <li>Directions from my home (and work, if I am insured through my employer).</li> <li>Information on what to expect with physical therapy, average recovery time, and other options available – for example, if other patients had good results using a chiropractor.</li> </ul> <p>Provide members with context around the cost of care, directly addressing topics like deductibles and coinsurance. Leveraging high-level data about patients with similar conditions, present other options that the member may want to consider. Keep in mind that health insurers should be part of the healthcare delivery model &#8211; not just the financier.</p> <p><strong>Transparency means advising on how to use insurance when the need arises.</strong> Members want guidance on using their insurance more cost-effectively. This is different from onboarding…sort of. Keep in mind that member orientation is an ongoing process. Someone considering elective surgery or with a baby on the way will likely require some guidance on how best to utilize their insurance coverage for those <a title="Don’t Wait for your Customers to Call You" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-wait-for-your-customers-to-call-you/" target="_blank">life events</a>.</p> <p>Develop a member engagement strategy to address common medical situations, prioritized by scenarios where the most waste is occurring, i.e. emergency rooms vs. urgent care facilities. A PPO member might schedule an appointment with a specialist without seeing a general doctor. They may be self-diagnosing, resulting in an unnecessary and pricey medical service.</p> <p>Cost, context, and advice &#8211; have you provided these for your members lately?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/healthcare-cost-transparency/">Healthcare Cost Transparency: What have you done for consumers lately?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Amy Widicus wrote about<a title="Delightful Customer Experiences Mean IT and Marketing Must Play Nice" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/delightful-customer-experiences-mean-marketing-must-play-nice/" target="_blank"> the need for Marketing and IT to come together to meet strategic business and customer needs</a>. The era of separate goals and departmental focus is gone, and budgets and timelines have flattened the landscape to where companies cannot afford to be siloed within Marketing and IT any longer. Where is the meeting place between these two seemingly dissimilar disciplines? User Experience (UX) is the name of this intersection.</p> <p>In the past, UX was often understood as User Interface design (UI), but there is a real and significant difference between UX and UI. While UI is an important discipline that includes the planning, design and testing of web/social pages and information structure, it is only one component of UX &#8211; the ‘gestalt’ of the user experience. This might mean market research, site usability, content strategy and development, site editorial planning, and marketing delivery, design and information architecture. These things knit together to form the whole of a user’s impression and successful interaction with a site. A strong UX strategy needs to address:</p> <ul> <li>Who are we speaking to? Where are they coming from? What other sites will they have experienced?</li> <li>What are their needs as a user or customer?</li> <li>What needs do we have as a business and what markets are we trying to reach/serve?</li> <li>What information is relevant, recent, related and how can we ensure that users find it?</li> <li>What actions do users need/want to take and with what frequency?</li> <li>How often are information updates needed and where?</li> </ul> <p>Delivering against that strategy requires Marketing and IT to come together to determine the best approach to ensure a premium user experience every time.</p> <p>For example: let’s imagine that a primary business need is to increase market share in a specific state. The Marketing team may be tasked with messaging, frequency, media type, and budget, which includes marketing on the web. In order to successfully deliver campaigns or other messaging, the marketing team depends on IT to provide the platform in which they can deliver those messages, to the right audience, with the right frequency to close the gap on the overall user experience. The site must deliver on the brand and messaging promise in a clear, consistent way, to ensure that the end-user is not confused, led astray, or worst – angered. The IT team, on the other hand, may have technological or budgetary limitations, and may not be able to deliver exactly as desired within a given platform, CMS tool or timeframe.</p> <p>This is where the UX intersection becomes most critical: how can we deliver excellent experience against a business strategy with a cohesive marketing plan to target specific customers within given technical and budgetary constraints? Coming together as a single team, under the UX umbrella, can help Marketing and IT groups ride out the storm of indecision, disparate priorities and conflicting time constraints. By using a common vernacular and focusing on the common goal of customer/user need, teams can overcome the silos they often find themselves in, and create solutions that build the organization as a whole.</p> <p>How can we start talking UX? For starters, get teams to speak and understand the same language. Some industries, such as manufacturing and logistics are behind the UX curve, while others, such as retail are light years ahead. Leveling the playing field by hosting brown bag lunches, inviting guest speakers, or conducting training workshops where Marketing and IT come together to ‘think UX’ can be a good start. Get team members to join online UX groups or discussion forums to stay abreast of trends and new developments, and to hear how other teams overcome similar challenges. Cultural change can be slow – UX makes it possible for all players to play for the same team &#8211; the first hurdle to leap.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/ux-intersection-marketing-street-street/">UX: The Intersection of Marketing Avenue and IT Street</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.sharepointconference.com/" target="_blank">SharePoint Conference 2014</a> just weeks away, we’re looking forward to immersing ourselves in all things SharePoint – particularly our areas of expertise: architecture strategy, solution design, and deployment. What is top of mind at this year’s event?</p> <p><b>User Adoption</b><br /> Gartner predicts that by 2016, 50% of content and collaboration initiatives will fail because of low engagement with the information workers they are intended to serve. Without user adoption, SharePoint has zero chance of  fostering workforce productivity in your organization – and ultimately it will fail.</p> <p>At Tahoe, we work to understand your users’ requirements and leverage SharePoint to design a solution that will engage your users and lead them to visit proactively. An intranet redesign for a large professional services firm resulted in 86% increased usage and a 300% increase in content contributors.</p> <p>You can <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: User Experience and Change Resilient Design" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-user-experience-and-change-resilient-design/" target="_blank">read more about our approach to User-Centered design here</a>, or let’s talk details at SPC14.</p> <p><b>Business Critical SharePoint Solutions</b><br /> Tahoe Partners is a Microsoft Gold Partner, but we are also a worldwide Microsoft Business Critical SharePoint Solution Partner. While many firms can stand up your SharePoint environment, what differentiates us is our ability to deliver Line of Business solutions within SharePoint that drive measured business value.</p> <p>A recent <a title="SharePoint LOB Applications: Smart Technology for Product Management" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-lob-applications-smart-technology-product-management/" target="_blank">LOB solution</a> for a consumer packaged goods company in the food and beverage vertical provided a framework to quickly identify opportunities and eliminate redundancies in the product lifecycle – significantly decreasing the time spent taking a product from an idea to the shelf. In total, our client was able to reduce process times by as much as 90%, and the overall approval process by 50%.</p> <p><b>Social Business</b><br /> We’ve all heard that social tools like Yammer and NewsGator can help businesses work smarter and more efficiently, but Tahoe Partners has helped clients realize tangible ROI with these tools.</p> <p>Tahoe helped an international vehicle manufacture with a <a title="Collaborative Workflow: Ideas Program, Bottom Line Savings" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/collaborative-workflow-ideas-program-bottom-line-savings/">social business initiative</a> designed to reduce cost, generate revenue, and engage their corporate citizens.</p> <p>In addition to over 1,800 ideas submitted within the first six months of the program, participation included employees from manufacturing locations, corporate headquarters, and distribution centers. Once implemented, these ideas resulted in 5.3 million dollars in savings for our client.</p> <p><b>Migrating to SharePoint 2013</b><br /> As you look to upgrade your SharePoint environment and take advantage of the features and functionality SharePoint 2013 offers, we can discuss best practices, lessons learned, and what to expect &#8211; as we’ve successfully completed dozens of migrations from SharePoint 2007 to 2010; 2010 to 2013; and in some cases 2007 to 2013.</p> <p><b>SharePoint Strategy</b><br /> The initiatives above are great ways to drive value out of SharePoint, but when it comes down to it, SharePoint is an Enterprise Collaboration <i>platform</i> and there is A LOT you can do with it. Before embarking on a SharePoint project, it’s crucial to have a long-term strategy and vision.</p> <p>Our proprietary roadmap establishes a baseline for the current collaboration environment, identifies the desired future state, and phases the appropriate initiatives in a timeline to move towards that desired state.</p> <p>As you begin to finalize your schedule for SharePoint Conference 2014, be sure to add a visit to Tahoe Partners (Booth #234) to the top of your agenda, or contact us to set up a time to meet:</p> [contact-form] <p>See you in Las Vegas!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-conference-2014/">SharePoint Conference 2014: Strategy &#038; Solutions</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance. Before accusing me of stating the obvious, think for a minute about the enormity of that statement. This is about much more than affordable health insurance. For example, race remains a significant factor in determining how and where an individual receives care and the quality of that care.</p> <p>Peeling back the layers of complexity, language emerges as a common theme. For this reason, many healthcare providers and payers are paying closer attention to how they support Spanish-dominant and bilingual customers.  And, they are quickly realizing that their <i>en Español</i> button is infuriating some of their most highly prized customers. Some examples in a recent study include:</p> <ul> <li>Poor (and sometimes embarrassing) language translation. Remember the Chevy Nova, which in Spanish translates to ‘Chevy no go.’</li> <li>Broken links and a user experience that jumps back and forth between English and Spanish. More than half the Spanish links on some payer sites took users to non-Spanish pages. Moreover, some users were directed to online forms in English that asked for personal information, prompting one user to say, “[translated] they’re trying to deceive me.”</li> <li>Difficulty finding a Spanish customer service number, let alone trying to find a Spanish-speaking medical provider online.</li> </ul> <p>These are just some of the challenges that Spanish-dominant customers face when trying to transact online. And the problems only compound when you look across channels.</p> <p>All that UX testing you did on your English website was exactly that: testing for your English-speaking audience. If you haven’t already, it may be an eye-opening exercise to run similar test with your Spanish-speaking audience. How do you think you’ll do?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/en-espanol/">How&#8217;s Your <em>en Español</em> ?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Those of you familiar with Tahoe Partners know that we are a Microsoft Business Critical SharePoint Partner, with a focus on delivering solutions that change the way people engage and collaborate. With that disclaimer made: I recently had the pleasure of participating in an informal roundtable discussion comprised of business and IT professionals, addressing <i>the benefits and challenges of today’s collaboration environment – both within and outside of the workplace</i>.</p> <p>As you would expect, consensus was quickly reached on several key points:</p> <ul> <li>Collaboration (defined as tools, collaboration platforms and line-of-business solutions) has become a core IT portfolio asset of most large organizations</li> <li>Mobility and cloud-based deployments, as they relate to collaboration, are gaining significant momentum and will become commonplace in the near future</li> <li>Organizations are now exploring the integration of enterprise social solutions with their collaborative platforms, as well as their other enterprise application solutions</li> </ul> <p>Having established that baseline, we explored the good, the bad and the ugly of today’s collaboration environment <i>and</i> the expectations of its user-community. Over the course of the discussion, we touched on everything from organizational culture to business process, user-expectations to structured systems versus collaboration solutions, and beyond. After much healthy debate, we focused on two primary themes regarding collaboration – User Experience, emphasized by the business-centric participants, and Data Reliability, driven by the IT participants.<b><i></i></b></p> <p><b>User Experience</b> &#8211; deploying collaborative solutions that match the expectations of the user community. That is, implementing business-centric solutions that match the power and simplicity of the technologies that today’s workforce uses in their everyday lives. People will adopt solutions that they enjoy &#8211; adoption drives engagement, and engagement drives innovation and productivity.</p> <p><b>Data Reliability</b> – providing (and managing) relevant, robust data within the context of the collaborative solution. While user experience is the catalyst for adoption, confidence in the information available is the cornerstone for producing real value with the collaborative solution. An ever increasing amount (and variety) of information is now made available across the extended enterprise. Structured (and protected) data is exposed and intermingled with unstructured data. Users hold more power than ever to interpret, combine, transform and communicate this data – ultimately turning it into information that enables the workforce, drives decisions, and fosters productivity and innovation.</p> <p>While both areas present immediate challenges, and both are critical elements in the deployment of highly successful collaboration environments, <b>Data Reliability</b> was identified as the area that gave everyone the most heartburn.</p> <p>Most organizations are thoughtful (if not diligent) in their use of security and infrastructure management solutions, simply because these tools are part of the everyday responsibilities of their IT organizations. However, these same companies found it much more difficult to successfully implement solutions and functions driven by, and dependent upon, continuous execution and management by their respective business communities. These types of solutions include governance automation and compliance functions (amongst others) provided by industry leaders such as <a title="AvePoint" href="http://www.avepoint.com/" target="_blank">AvePoint</a>. To quote one participant, “internal business communities do not yet associate these types of responsibilities with their collaborative platforms.”</p> <p>The reasons given and agreed upon by participants in this situation included:</p> <ul> <li>Business driven collaboration strategies are not clearly defined</li> <li>Business ownership and accountability for collaborative platforms, associated solutions and data are not clearly defined</li> <li>Governance of the data, business processes and user access is not clearly defined</li> <li>Compliance is not appropriately or effectively managed and reported</li> </ul> <p>While the group did not reach a resolution on these issues (perhaps a bit out of scope for one evening’s discussion), some core insights emerged:</p> <ul> <li>Participants coalesced around a common understanding of the various challenges associated with deploying effective collaboration solutions</li> <li>They realized that their challenges and concerns were not unique to them but common across organizations</li> <li>Collaborative solutions can provide greater access to and extend the reach of data and information across the enterprise. However, access to the structured/ unstructured data can cause real issues if not appropriately managed</li> <li>Collaborative platforms allow for an effective avenue to more easily change and adapt business processes outside the norm of their existing enterprise applications</li> <li>IT can provide the enabling technology for establishing the collaborative environment, but the business community must own and drive accountability and business benefit</li> </ul> <p>Personally, I couldn’t be more excited about the outcome of these discussions. Tahoe’s focus as an organization is to change the way people engage and collaborate. The challenges identified are truly the strengths of our services, and we’re looking forward to a busy 2014!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/challenges-collaboration-business-roundtable/">The Challenges of Collaboration: A Business and IT Roundtable</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when IT and Marketing could wage war and still meet customer expectations.

st for the customer. I know&#8230; it’s not easy. Marketers complain that IT is slow and unresponsive. IT complains that Marketing has gone rogue – believe me, I’ve heard it all. But now is the time to come together.</p> <p>Here are 5 good reasons to walk down the hall and call a truce:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Data Analytics</strong> – This information is key on both sides of the aisle. Marketers must know what are your customers doing, saying, reading, buying, and learn from their behaviors and react. Create more personalized experiences where it’s possible. IT can provide this data. It goes beyond the Google Analytics report – it’s within your CRM, ERP, and CMS systems (and I’m sure a host of other 3 letter acronyms). Delve deeper than page visits to dive into the real meat of how customers are behaving. Which leads us to….</li> <li><strong>System Integration</strong> – The more integrated the systems, the easier it is to tell a consistent story. If front end marketing systems are walled off from backend systems, getting the full data analytics picture gets more complex. If IT is part of the process of implementing analytics technology and involved in how data is collected, there can be synergies with the rest of the backend technology platforms.</li> <li><strong>Platform Buy-in</strong> – Customers demand real-time responses and robust experiences. Marketers need flexible and agile systems to allow them to respond quickly to customer requests. However, when a marketing-focused platform is selected in isolation, this has repercussions for the IT organization. Support, maintenance and integration all come into play. Consider both sides of the coin when selecting Content Management Systems, CRM systems, and other tools that are part of the overall customer solution landscape. IT – recognize that existing tools and technologies may not meet the increasing demands that marketing requires. Marketing – understand that without IT buy-in, it will be difficult to get ongoing, long-term support, and to put together a full data analytics picture.</li> <li><strong>Consistent Experience</strong> – Ensure the customer will have a consistent experience with all of their digital interactions. If there is a division between Marketing and IT, there can be a breakdown in the experience during the customer lifecycle. If the customer moves from the browsing the web to picking up the phone and calling customer service, will customer service understand that they may have run into problems on the web? Working together ensures systems and processes at the front and back end of the customer experience are in sync.</li> <li><strong>Solution Execution</strong> – It takes a village… to get your digital strategy humming. Marketing wants to meet customer needs and deliver a delightful customer experience. IT wants the technology to be stable and supportable. When delivering web sites, mobile solutions, shopping carts, intranets, and all other sorts of digital initiatives, it takes both marketing and IT to bring it all together. Working collaboratively improves on-time, on-budget project delivery. Leverage business and system analysts to act as liaisons, ensuring that each area understands what the other needs. Communicate… a lot… and then some more, at every stage of the project.</li> </ol> <p>The other day I was talking to <a title="Five Strategies for Managing Digital Projects in a Changing Health Care Environment" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/five-strategies-managing-digital-projects-changing-health-care-environment/" target="_blank">one of our guest bloggers, Doug Loots</a>, who has traditionally been on the marketing side. As part of his career growth, he is considering digging deeper into technology, since it’s becoming such a critical component of the overall solution. Just another anecdote indicating the need to break down barriers between Marketing and IT in order to act as a cohesive team in meeting customers’ needs and delivering outstanding customer experiences.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/delightful-customer-experiences-mean-marketing-must-play-nice/">Delightful Customer Experiences Mean IT and Marketing Must Play Nice</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

our trusted physician mentioning to you the difficulty of working with an insurance company. You might think twice about selecting the same company during the next enrollment period. Compare this to a physician remarking on how easy your insurer is to work with….</p> <p>Unfortunately, providers are spending more and more time on administrative tasks, leading to frustration, low morale and high fatigue. Some of this is the result of mandated paperwork and hard to improve. However, a well-designed provider portal – one that improves efficiency by streamlining routine activities – can help make the provider-insurer relationship a better partnership. Many organizations have implemented provider portals with minimal, disjointed functionality, only to find that usage decreases as the portal becomes little more than a gateway to access third-party tools.</p> <p>To engage and deliver value to providers, an effective provider portal should provide the right mix of information and functionality, including:</p> <p><b>Directed communication</b><br /> Understanding that a provider’s time is very limited, directed communication ensures a personalized experience, delivering relevant content rather than making them sort through information that isn’t pertinent.</p> <p><b>Allows providers to perform administrative tasks</b><br /> Administrative tasks might include updating demographic information, re-credentialing with an insurer, or assigning permissions to office staff members. These functions should be synced with a backend system, and be seamless to the provider.</p> <p><b>Empowers providers to perform visit-related tasks</b><br /> This is perhaps the most important aspect of the provider portal, and when done well, should integrate easily into their daily work. Tasks associated with a patient visit might include eligibility checks, cost estimator tools, and claims status.</p> <p><b>Provides a central location for reference materials.</b><br /> One critical task of a provider portal is managing the significant amount of material attached to the provider-insurer relationship. Not only is the breadth of documentation large, but it frequently changes. Creating a centralized location is crucial to keeping your provider network informed, as well as minimizing frustration caused by out-of-date information. Consider including items such as drug codes, fee schedules, regulatory information, etc. However, it is not enough to just have materials available—they should be presented in a manner that makes them easy to search and to locate.</p> <p>A robust provider portal offers key functionalities that make daily tasks easier, more convenient, and can play a vital role in building and maintaining a provider-insurer relationship. A useful portal leads to high provider satisfaction, which can spill over to the patients they see – all while reducing costs associated with manual processes. In addition to a member portal, a provider portal should be part of any payer’s digital strategy to communicate, interact, and engage with providers.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/provider-portals-key-insurer-provider-relationship/">Provider Portals Key to the Insurer-Provider Relationship</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

Perhaps most importantly, it offers an opportunity to get everyone synchronized and committed to the pursuit. The right workflows ensure the correct people are involved in a timely and transparent fashion. Team members can leverage existing proposal content quickly, making for a more efficient and quicker process.

We don’t think so. Sales people like to do what helps them be most efficient and in the end, to make money. Meaningful collaboration, real-time transparency, and a rich and personalized experience with your customers all deliver results.</p> <p>Stay tuned as we continue to explore the Now Enterprise: productivity, performance and engagement – delivered.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/collaborative-selling-nowenterprise-future-focused-customers/">Collaborative Selling with the NowEnterprise: A Future Focused on Your Customers</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The Affordable Care Act has marked several key deadlines over the last three years, but with mandatory coverage in place and 2.2 million new entrants in the health insurance market, we expect 2014 to be a banner year for the healthcare industry. Where is healthcare headed in 2014? Here are our top predictions:</p> <p><b>The Growing Role of Technology </b><br /> For payers and providers alike, technology has the potential to personalize and enrich the consumer experience. From cutting-edge apps to electronic healthcare records, finding innovative ways to increase efficiency and improve quality of care will continue to be an industry-wide priority in 2014. We foresee an influx of tools to measure effectiveness, share best practices, and promote agility.</p> <p>For consumers, scheduling appointments becomes easier as online tools for around the clock booking become more refined. An interface allowing insurance shoppers to view all private, state and federally run exchanges within a single online marketplace will allow easy cost, benefit, and quality comparisons. Health insurers will tap into the power of big data, acquiring population health data as they seek to improve plan offerings in alignment with trends in the marketplace. Developments in genetics and genomics tracking and testing will make diagnoses more precise, with tools such as <a href="http://www.youscript.com/">YouScript</a> emerging to determine the most effective treatment and dosage for individual patients.</p> <p><b>A Customer-centric Approach </b><br /> As empowered consumers take control of their own care, they will seek out a more efficient, seamless, holistic (and affordable) healthcare experience, demanding readily available, user-friendly access to their own health data. Information is powerful, and robust self-service tools will be needed to keep pace with consumer expectations.</p> <p>When it comes to delivering quality care, Accountable Care Organizations will take on an increased role in preventative care and proactive health management. Customized healthcare, tailored to individual patients, becomes the new normal.</p> <p><b>Transparency Becomes More… Transparent</b><br /> The push for transparency will maintain forward momentum in 2014. In addition to comparing deductibles and co-pays, insurers will provide more complete picture of the true costs and benefits of insurance plans, giving shoppers greater insight into the quality and value of their coverage.</p> <p><b>Competition Spurs Innovation</b><br /> Increasing competition means that payers and providers alike will need to differentiate themselves with quality of care and effective outcomes. One key to succeeding in this competitive market will be endless innovation. Non-traditional entrants to the marketplace are expected to partner with traditional players to create new, lifestyle-based models of healthcare.</p> <p><b>Around the Clock Accessibility</b><br /> Consumers have come to expect information and service available anytime, anywhere. We will continue to see that reflected across the industry, as a push toward near-constant accessibility makes care and information available around the clock and across multiple devices.</p> <p>Reaching the ever increasing number of newly insured, and delivering on the promise of valuable, available healthcare will rely heavily on technology. For insurers, the key to success in this new marketplace is a well-defined digital strategy that enables a new level of engagement with an expanding customer base.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/2014-healthcare-predictions/">Where is Healthcare Headed in 2014?

<![CDATA[
<p>Visiting most corporate intranets could be likened to a trip to Dunkin Donuts. You get what you came for – great coffee and maybe a donut or bagel – and you leave. It gets the job done, but there is no reason to stay. Contrast that to Starbucks. You still get a great cup of coffee and a nice scone. But they also provide free wi-fi, comfortable chairs and tables, and a pleasant atmosphere. You feel more inclined to grab a seat, stay a while, and do a little work. Cross a few things off your to-do list. All of a sudden, it starts to become part of your new routine. It becomes part of a new expectation….</p> <p>So what does this have to do with Intranets? When we work with our clients to conduct an Intranet redesign, one of the first things we always do is conduct a survey. Question #1 is always the same: “What reasons do you visit your corporate intranet?”</p> <p>The top answer? The corporate phone directory and org chart. There’s your coffee.</p> <p>The second most popular answer? HR Forms. There’s your donut.</p> <p>Then they leave.</p> <p>There is also an even bigger problem with this scenario. Often, that information is out of date. So this is even worse than the Dunkin Donuts comparison. Your coffee is now served cold. Your donut is stale. Eventually, you go somewhere else.</p> <p>So how do you go about fixing these fundamental issues? It goes without saying that information must be updated. That is a given. But how do you create something that makes them not only want to come back, but also stay and do more?</p> <p>To be fair, when many intranets launched, their capabilities were limited by the lack of some key technologies. That has changed dramatically. As a result, delivering a new version of your intranet that builds on what’s already in place is usually the absolute wrong thing to do. Adding new features to an under-adopted solution isn’t going to get it done. It’s time for an overhaul.</p> <p>Now those key technologies not only exist, but also are quite powerful. The mobile revolution has put smart phones and tablets in the hands of everyone in your workforce. This dramatically increases the ability to access information from anywhere at any time. Best practices for design have changed as a result. Swipe and tap is the new point and click and, yes, good design still needs to translate seamlessly to a PC. The advance of technologies like HTML5 and JS along with the proliferation of device-based apps has elevated user expectations for a much richer and more interactive digital experience. Finally, social technologies have radically changed how people engage with each other, collaborate, and keep up with information. Social is becoming embedded in our work.</p> <p>Let’s get back to our survey. Further down that list of questions, we ask…”what do you want from your intranet?” We generally find the responses are not only quite broad, but also differ by demographic. We find that the younger the workforce, the greater the expectations.  They expect it in their personal lives and they bring that same expectation to the workplace.</p> <p>So what is this New Expectation? It is an expectation to develop a relationship that is much deeper than just information. How do I connect and build relationships with the people around me? How do I connect with the culture? How do I foster my career? Oh, and I want to have fun doing it…</p> <p>From here, we begin to create user personas. As we develop these, we see a very interesting thing happen. Universally, there are three mindsets that we consistently find when conducting the personas.</p> <ul> <li>I want to be highly productive person on a day-to-day basis. I need tools at my fingertips.</li> <li>I have a career path that I am working on. I need information to foster that.</li> <li>I want to enjoy my experience at work. I want this to be more than just a job to me.</li> </ul> <p>So how can we build an enterprise experience that satisfies these mindsets? How do we build the NowEnterprise?</p> <p>Stay tuned as we further elaborate on the NowEnterprise in the coming weeks. It will be a journey you won’t want to miss.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/intranets-say-hello-nowenterprise/">Goodbye Intranet.

<![CDATA[
<p>From computer glitches, to shifting deadlines, to the extension of existing policies, the journey from the launch of HealthCare.gov on October 1, 2013 to today has been eventful to say the least. Looking back on the last three months we find ourselves asking, has the healthcare exchange lived up to its initial promise?</p> <p>When the exchanges went live, initial glitches were attributed to an influx of visitors overloading the website. However, it quickly became clear that the errors were due more to inadequate programming and testing than to any surge in visitors. It took two months, an army of experts and consultants, and approximately 400 fixes to finally stabilize the site. Today, HealthCare.gov is reported to handle up to 50,000 concurrent users and up to 800,000 visitors per day, although glitches persist and the site is still only available about 95% of the time.</p> <p>In terms of sheer enrollment numbers, pre-launch estimates expected 7 million individuals to sign up for insurance through the exchange. However, as of October 31, 2013, only 50,000 people had enrolled. A week before the enrollment deadline for coverage on January 1, 2014, just one third of an estimated 3.3 million people had signed up through the federal exchange; however, an additional 1.1 million individuals purchased insurance during the last week of enrollment, totaling approximately 2.2 million enrollees by the end of December 2013. The latest numbers for this month are not yet available, nor are final numbers from the various state-run exchanges.</p> <p>Has the federal healthcare exchange lived up to its promise? As with any new, untested rollout at such a large scale, hiccups are inevitable, and initial estimates of any new system are bound to have a large margin of variance. For now, we’re reserving judgment – ultimately, what happens between now and the final purchase deadline of March 31, 2014, as well as the 2015 enrollment period, will determine the final verdict on the success of the healthcare exchange.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/healthcare-gov-lived-promise/">Has HealthCare.gov lived up to its promise?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In the prosperous years of the pre-2008 American economy, it was easier for firms to focus their attention on revenue targets rather than other aspects of performance. With the economic downturn, many organizations began scrutinizing the cost impact to their bottom line. As part of our SharePoint Line of Business Application series, we’ll share an example of how SharePoint can be leveraged to reduce an organization&#8217;s costs, resulting in material savings.</p> <p>Tahoe Partners was enlisted to build an innovation platform for an international vehicle manufacturer. The goal of the initiative was to reduce cost, generate revenue, and engage and empower their corporate citizens. SharePoint was selected not only for its workflow capabilities, but also for its social features.</p> <p>An innovation and ideation program was launched to gather and evaluate ideas from all levels of the organization. Based on an expert team evaluation, an idea may be selected for implementation. Employees were encouraged to submit ideas through a variety of incentives, including a points system, where they were awarded points for implemented ideas that could be redeemed for a variety of prizes. Within the first six months, employees from across the company submitted more than 1,800 ideas.</p> <p>The SharePoint application delivered to implement this program featured the following:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Submitting an Idea</strong> &#8211; The user enters the information necessary to evaluate the idea, including anticipated savings or revenue projections.  The idea capture form leverages SharePoint&#8217;s Active Directory Integration with their HR systems to improve usability for the idea submitter.</li> <li><strong>Automatically Routing an Idea for Evaluation</strong> &#8211; Based on a hierarchy of categorization, the idea is routed to the appropriate subject matter expert team. That team receives an email notifying them of the action required, as well as reminders in subsequent weeks if no action is taken. To enforce an unbiased review, the evaluator does not have access to the idea author&#8217;s information.</li> <li><strong>Automatically Sending Status Updates to the Author of the Idea</strong> &#8211; As the idea flows through the process, the author receives email updates to keep them informed on the idea’s status. Employees reported that receiving regular updates on ideas they submitted promoted stronger adoption of the overall ideas program.</li> <li><strong>Searching Evaluated Ideas</strong> &#8211; In order to prevent duplicate ideas and inspire cumulative innovative thinking, all ideas that have completed the evaluation process are public and searchable through SharePoint&#8217;s FAST search capabilities.</li> <li><strong>Dashboard of Idea Metrics</strong> &#8211; For evaluators and administrators of the program, configurable dashboards are available to view their action items, review the status of a queue, and view metrics on the program.</li> </ol> <p>With over 1,800 ideas submitted within the first six months of the program, participation included employees from manufacturing locations, corporate headquarters, and distribution centers.  Once implemented, these ideas resulted in 5.3 million dollars in savings for our client. This SharePoint solution is industry agnostic, and could be leveraged in your organization to engage and empower your workforce to have a direct impact on your business&#8217; bottom line.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/collaborative-workflow-ideas-program-bottom-line-savings/">Collaborative Workflow: Ideas Program, Bottom Line Savings</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

Since I&#8217;m using the same OOTB page, I don&#8217;t have to worry about recreating code to manually add users to a group or site.</p> <p>Let&#8217;s look at the out-of-the-box Grant Permissions (/_layouts/aclinv.aspx) page and Email Template.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sp-greantpermissions-ootb.jpg"><img alt="sp-greantpermissions-ootb" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sp-greantpermissions-ootb-249x300.jpg" width="249" height="300" /></a>    <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sp-welcomeemail-ootb.jpg"><img alt="sp-welcomeemail-ootb" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sp-welcomeemail-ootb-300x197.jpg" width="300" height="197" /></a></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/anolan/archive/2008/01/07/is-it-possible-to-modify-sharepoint-email-notifications.aspx" target="_blank">This MSDN post</a> confirms that the 1st and 3rd paragraph of the email body cannot be customized OOTB.</p> <p>What if you&#8217;d like to send your users a more personalized Welcome Email?</p> <p><strong>The Goal</strong><br /> We&#8217;ll reuse the Grant Permissions page and have it send the Welcome Email using our own template.</p> <p>Below is what the Grant Permissions page and Welcome Email should look like after our changes.

It was a great starting point, but we want to do more than just adding a control to the page.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s a summary of the steps I followed to customize the SharePoint Welcome Email:</p> <ol> <li><strong> Modify the Aclinv.aspx page via jQuery to:</strong> <ol> <li>Uncheck the Send Email checkbox to prevent the page from sending the default email</li> <li>Hide all Send Email controls</li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Create an HTTP Module to:</strong> <ol> <li>Add a custom Send Email checkbox below the user picker (this will allow users to still be able to choose whether they want to send the Welcome Email)</li> <li>Send custom email to user(s) using our own email template</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p><strong>The Code</strong><br /> If you&#8217;re not familiar with HTTP Modules, check out this article: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30907/The-Two-Interceptors-HttpModule-and-HttpHandlers">The Two Interceptors: HttpModule and HttpHandlers</a>. It also covers the events that we will make use of to add our own Send Email checkbox and send the custom email.</p> <p>We will also make use of jQuery selectors.

<p>As the title implies, I won’t venture to call this a complete overview of PowerPivot for SharePoint. What follows is a review for those just beginning to contemplate leveraging PowerPivot for SharePoint, by a SharePoint Administrator with just enough experience and exposure to want to help. Tha

<![CDATA[
t said, this has been written for those with almost no exposure to Microsoft BI, general analysis services, dashboarding, or any of the other buzzwords <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=PowerPivot&amp;cmpt=q" target="_blank">dramatically increasing in popularity</a>. If you have a comfortable familiarity with Excel and a working knowledge of SharePoint Service Applications, you can use this post as a guide for setting up your first development environment.</p> <p><strong>What is PowerPivot for SharePoint?</strong><br /> If SharePoint and Excel Services are your family sedan, installing components for PowerPivot for SharePoint is like adding a turbo, wings, and an airport. Your sedan handled a basic workload just fine, but now the possibilities and capacity are limited only by your imagination (and a few things listed below). More technically put, PowerPivot for SharePoint enables external data connections, greatly increases the computing capabilities and efficiency of PowerPivot-enabled Excel Workbooks, and enables new features and functions that make combining and visualizing data on SharePoint a realistic venture for any size organization.</p> <p>Many people are initially confused when attempting to internalize their own definition of PowerPivot for SharePoint, due to the many ways that PowerPivot (as a collection of components) fits in to the Microsoft ecosystem. For our purposes, you will be working toward using the <i>Power Pivot add-in for Excel</i> to create an <i>Excel Workbook</i> to be accessed in an <i>Excel Web Access</i> web part served via <i>Excel Web Services </i>and <i>PowerPivot for SharePoint,</i> supported on the back-end by <i>PowerPivot for SQL Analysis Services</i>. These are all entirely different entities, which while directly and sequentially related, can be utilized and consumed in many different ways.</p> <p><em><strong>What do I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> to know?</strong></em></p> <p><strong>The Components</strong><br /> I’ve summarized a few key points for each component; however, when performing the installation, read the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff487867(v=sql.105).aspx" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Make your <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee210603(v=sql.105).aspx#serviceaccounts" target="_blank">service accounts</a> first.  Many known issues are covered, and user comments may help along the way.</p> <ul> <li>PowerPivot System Service and Analysis Services service: <ul> <li>Installed First – dependent on new installation.</li> <li>Installed through SQL Server Setup – typically requires either a dedicated server or SQL instance.</li> </ul> </li> <li>PowerPivot service application: <ul> <li>Installed and Run on one or more APP servers in your farm.</li> </ul> </li> <li>PowerPivot Web service: <ul> <li>Installed and Runs on each WFE in your farm.</li> </ul> </li> <li>PowerPivot application database: <ul> <li>Created in SQL when the PowerPivot service application is created.</li> </ul> </li> <li>PowerPivot content and libraries: <ul> <li>Added by users with appropriate permissions to SharePoint Sites.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>The Hard Limits</strong><br /> There are a number of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee210640(v=sql.105).aspx" target="_blank">System Requirements</a> and configuration pre-requisites that must be met; the majority of these are superseded by the requirements of running Windows Server and SQL or SharePoint. A brief overview of some of the more “unexpected” points follows:</p> <ul> <li>SQL Edition</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be sure to pay attention to which <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">edition</span></i> of SQL you’re using. Regardless of what <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">version</span></i> you are using, only certain <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">editions</span></i> of SQL support PowerPivot services. For example, if you are running SQL 2012, you must have either the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc645993(SQL.110).aspx#PowerPivot" target="_blank">Business Intelligence or Enterprise edition</a>.</p> <ul> <li>Classic-Mode Authentication</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">PowerPivot services can only be installed and run on web applications that are configured with Classic-Mode authentication. The most common workaround for showing your dashboards on a claims based web application is to host the workbooks and PowerPivot galleries on a dedicated web application in the same Farm, and then expose the dashboards through Excel web services. There’s a fair amount of configuration, some serious security considerations, and some capabilities lost with this method; however, this requirement isn’t going to change any time soon.</p> <ul> <li>Data Refresh Scheduling</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is important to set the expectations for the frequency at which any external data refresh or re-calculation can be handled. Out of the box, a single daily refresh is the highest available frequency. There are workarounds to defeat this schedule, but most require code-based solutions or un-supported “hacks.”</p> <ul> <li>Workbook limitations</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Many administrators are already familiar with these limitations as they apply to Excel Web Access and SharePoint more specifically than PowerPivot for SharePoint. Before designing your dashboard’s appearance and functionality, I highly recommend reviewing “Differences between using a workbook in the browser and in Excel” <i>for</i> <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-server-help/differences-between-using-a-workbook-in-the-browser-and-in-excel-HA104009811.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA010369179">2010</a> and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint-server-help/differences-between-using-a-workbook-in-the-browser-and-in-excel-HA010369179.aspx" target="_blank">2013</a>. A few notable limitations include:</p> <ul> <ul> <li>No data validation may be used</li> <li>Any form tool bar controls or custom ActiveX controls</li> <li>No macros (no macro-enabled workbooks)</li> </ul> </ul> <p><strong>The Soft Limits</strong></p> <ul> <li>Governance</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">When effectively used, PowerPivot workbooks can grow to be very large in size – almost always larger than the default workbook size permitted by Excel Web Services and in extreme cases, larger than the maximum file upload size permitted by your web application. In addition, there are (astronomical) limits to the number of rows and other capacity limitations supported by PowerPivot. Having a clearly outlined policy for how and when PowerPivot workbooks and dashboards can be deployed is a key component of any governance plan.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be sure to consider that any changes or upgrades made to systems hosting external data sources leveraged by your workbooks will likely have an effect on your Dashboard, and potentially the external data connection itself. Ensure that any maintenance or upgrade to those external data sources is communicated to the person responsible for maintaining the Workbooks and Dashboards, as well as each PowerPivot component.</p> <ul> <li>Visual Design</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ultimately, you will be responsible for ensuring that the data is displayed in an effective and visually appealing way. If you’ll be displaying a dashboard on a web part page, one key consideration is to predetermine the width in pixels of the Excel Web Access web part. You can then adjust the size of your columns and page sizes in the workbook to ensure that your dashboard content fits as expected.</p> <ul> <li>Maintenance and Support</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Depending on the size of your organization, you may have specific teams at different levels of your infrastructure. Make sure to clearly define who is responsible for each component of PowerPivot for SharePoint so that all components are maintained consistently.</p> <p>As with anything SharePoint related, the community surrounding PowerPivot for SharePoint is expansive and very active &#8211; don&#8217;t hesitate to search for solutions on the web. While my experiences with formal training were very productive, I recommend drilling on an end-to-end configuration of a personal (non-production) dashboard before tackling any actual projects.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-powerpivot-beginners/">SharePoint &#038; PowerPivot for Beginners</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Recently, CIO.com posted an article titled “<a href="http://www.cio.com/article/743979/Why_Microsoft_SharePoint_Faces_a_Challenging_Future" target="_blank">Why Microsoft SharePoint Faces a Challenging Future</a>”, questioning Microsoft’s strategy around their SharePoint offering for moving toward Office 365 and the Cloud, as well as moving toward HTML5/JS – despite the fact that these are common industry trends. Further, it calls Microsoft&#8217;s future “murky” and “less rosy” than the success they have enjoyed to this point. I struggle with this article for a number of reasons, as it largely misses the mark on some key topics. While we can appreciate the author’s perspective on the risk of alienating a loyal developer base, that assessment is far too myopic when considering overall industry trends as a whole. One could even argue that when you look into the future of technology – depending on how far you look – the future is always murky to some degree.</p> <p><b>Start with a Simple Analogy</b><br /> Imagine you are a large auto manufacturer. This cool thing called the hybrid comes along, combining battery and gasoline to power an engine. These cars are delivering unbelievable gas mileage (and gas prices have doubled in 5 years), and are becoming commercially viable. Most of your competitors are going down this path and having success. One of your competitors is even proving out the ability to eliminate gas entirely, and their shareholders are being rewarded for it. Battery power is clearly a potential future solution. If you are the CEO of this company, would you at least explore this technology and throw your hat in the ring? Or would you say, no, let&#8217;s stick with what we are doing?</p> <p>While this analogy is very general and must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt, it underscores the importance of paying attention to industry trends. The author is suggesting that Microsoft largely ignore these new technologies (Cloud, more powerful front-end code languages) that the entire industry is chasing, and instead stick with their old model (on premises, pure C#, and ASP.NET). Microsoft is not ditching the old, but they are at least exploring the new.</p> <p><b>We’ve Seen This Story Before</b><br /> The software industry graveyard is littered with companies that refused to adapt their solutions to new technologies, and ignored trends. No one is suggesting Microsoft completely abandon the old &#8211; and they aren&#8217;t. But they better be able to shift to the new in the event that it becomes the new standard. Because if they don&#8217;t, and cloud DOES become the de facto standard, the number of angry customers will be logarithmically higher than that of current customers who may be unhappy that Microsoft has started to shift. The irony is that Microsoft has been burned in the past (and rightfully criticized) for taking the exact approach the author is suggesting they should. The mere fact that Microsoft is going a different route now is quite frankly forward-thinking – or at least “current thinking” – more so than we have seen coming out of Redmond in the past.</p> <p><b>So What About the Developers?</b><br /> Another interesting bit in the article states, “there&#8217;s no consistency to the guidance given to developers”.  The author is referring to the SharePoint 2013 App Model, and definitely missed the mark here. The App Model wasn’t intended to guide developers toward a particular development process; rather, it was architected so they have an enormous amount of flexibility and can work in the language they are most familiar with. Aligning SharePoint with the open development standards of the “web”, if anything, will reduce the barriers to entry in the SharePoint development space. And in strategy vernacular, reducing barriers to entry just adds to the supply of talent – something that only benefits Microsoft’s SharePoint platform.</p> <p><b>Wait, Doesn’t That Commoditize My Job?</b><br /> The decision to move to HTML5/Javascript was quite intentional. Yes, it removes barriers, but there is a lot more to it. Here is what else it does: it unifies the development platform much like you see the unification of the OS.</p> <p>What is Microsoft promoting for Windows 8 Development? <a href="http://t.co/lp4K0dBvES" target="_blank">HTML5/JS</a>.<a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sorry-cio-com-microsoft-got-one-right/"><br /> </a></p> <p>What is Microsoft promoting for Windows Phone App development? HTML5/JS.</p> <p>What is Microsoft promoting for Office Client development?  You guessed it &#8211; HTML5/JS.</p> <p>Microsoft did not miss the ball on this. And if you&#8217;re a C# developer without HTML5/JS skills, then be prepared to live the life of a COBOL/RPG developer.   What is worse than developers being upset about a platform and technology is to not be relevant to them at all.  In our opinion, any developer who isn&#8217;t willing to continue learning and changing with the latest technologies and trends may have picked the wrong profession.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sorry-cio-com-microsoft-got-one-right/">Sorry CIO.com, Microsoft Got This One Right</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>We have plenty to feel fortunate about here at Tahoe Partners – fortunate to call Chicago our home, fortunate to be a part of a burgeoning, innovative tech industry, and fortunate that our beloved Spartans are headed to the Rose Bowl for the first time in twenty-five years (errr, that might just be me…).</p> <p>This holiday season, we are thrilled to return some of that good fortune to the community we care so much about. The <a href="http://www.salarmychicago.org/angeltree/#sthash.Si2PYK5P.dpbs" target="_blank">Salvation Army Angel Tree</a> program helps to fulfill the holiday wishes of children in and around Chicago. Thanks to the generous donations of Tahoe employees, we were able to provide clothing and toys such as Easy Bake Ovens, CD players, craft supplies, and much more from the kids’ wish lists.</p> <p>We believe that giving back is more than just a social responsibility, it is a fundamental part of doing business here in Chicago. We’d love to hear about your charitable efforts this holiday season – how are you spreading cheer in your community?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/deck-halls-kids-need-tahoe-partners-joins-salvation-army-angel-tree-program/">Deck the Halls for Kids in Need: Tahoe Partners joins Salvation Army Angel Tree Program</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1. Know the “Whys” before the “Hows”</strong></p> <p>A mentor of mine early in my digital career used to say, “Doug, remember: strategy before structure.” This is great advice. All too often, organizations make the mistake of embarking on a project because it is the latest rag
]]>
<![CDATA[
e of the digital industry. Social media, search marketing, mobile applications, website redesigns, and responsive design all come to mind.</p> <p>Multiple times I’ve had employees say, “we need to redesign the website.” The first question I ask is “why?” Often the response is, “because we haven’t done it in two years.”</p> <p>Wrong answer….</p> <p>The right answer could be: 25% of our customers access our website via mobile device. We need to redesign it to be responsive and properly engage the consumer regardless of device.</p> <p>Tactics are easy. Strategy is hard. Know your “whys” before you embark on the “hows.”</p> <p><strong>2. Leverage data to manage people</strong></p> <p>Establishing clear goals and timelines for project delivery is simple. But time and time again projects fall into chaos because of the inability to properly measure the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people</span> engaged in the project.</p> <p>Data isn’t just about Gantt Charts and timelines. It’s also about people.</p> <p>Leverage the data from multiple projects over time to figure out who is failing to deliver, and then leverage that same data to find out why and manage to those reasons.</p> <p>Are they overloaded with other projects? Are they poor at estimating their time properly? Are they poor at multitasking? Have you staffed the project appropriately?</p> <p>Answering some of these questions can help you better manage the most important resource of any digital project &#8211; people.</p> <p><strong>3. Be Agile</strong></p> <p>It never fails. An organization gets a game-changing digital strategy and sets out to accomplish it. The timeline is 18 months. Resources are allocated, people mobilized, and everyone charges ahead. 24 months later, a solution is delivered that turns out to be troubled.</p> <p>What happened?</p> <p>The world changed. A lot can happen in two years. While everyone was busy building the solution, no one noticed the changing dynamics of the marketplace.</p> <p>A core tenet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development</a> is the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Not just internal requirement changes, but also external circumstances.</p> <p>Another mentor used to say, “don’t boil the ocean.” Deliver small, phased solutions quickly, while keeping the endgame in mind.</p> <p><strong>4. “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”</strong></p> <p>This Vincent Van Gogh quote, one of my favorites, has saved me many times from project management peril.  I’ve personally witnessed consumers log in to the customer portal to obtain an explanation of benefits, find a doctor, or some other routine activity, only to have to phone into the call center with questions because the digital solution creates confusion. At $6 per call….</p> <p>It is easy to add pages, links, and content to your digital asset. It’s much harder to add only items that truly matter and enhance the customer experience. Don’t let the website become a dumping ground for anything and everything.</p> <p>Striving to simplify digital not only simplifies your project, it serves your customer, and it serves your business.</p> <p><strong>5. “Know your Outs”</strong></p> <p>Professional poker players always calculate the odds of a winning or losing hand before proceeding with any move. This is called “knowing your outs.”</p> <p>The Affordable Care Act is the poster child of not knowing its outs. The retail exchanges were built and it’s now obvious &#8211; there wasn’t much of a backup plan.</p> <p>From my banking years, I’ve witnessed over a billion dollars spent and ten years wasted on a project with no solution delivered. Oh and by the way, it ruined a few careers.</p> <p>So &#8211; what is your digital project’s backup plan?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/five-strategies-managing-digital-projects-changing-health-care-environment/">Five Strategies for Managing Digital Projects in a Changing Health Care Environment</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>This year’s AHIP Operations and Technology forum communicated a clear message: Success for health care payers and providers hinges on the ability to reach consumers. To quote from the closing session, “Build it and they will come is a failure. Bring the game to the consumer.” What consumers

need to feel comfortable purchasing health coverage and maximizing benefit use is likely to shape where the industry goes next.</p> <p>Consumers are looking for buying health insurance to be as easy as purchasing an airplane ticket or ordering a book from Amazon. More specifically, consumers want:</p> <ul> <li>Costs to be available and transparent.</li> <li>The ability to easily compare benefits and health care options.</li> <li>To be approached as consumers, as opposed to “insureds” or “patients”.</li> <li>Messaging that demonstrates authentic understanding of individual consumer needs – down to cultural and community preferences, preferred communication modes, and information shared through terms and visual tools consumers find meaningful.</li> </ul> <p>The health insurance industry is in sync with consumers’ desire to be met where they are. According to one presentation, of 40 health plans surveyed, the topmost concern is consumer engagement. The options offered for achieving this?</p> <p><b>Individuation. </b>One message or outreach approach can no longer fit all. High-level market segmentation seems to be giving way to “audience fragmentation” (a phrase used by featured speaker Bill Lan &#8211; Google’s Head of Industry, Insurance &amp; Services). Reliable, consistent, accurate and empathetic communications can make a big impact in motivating consumers to respond. Acknowledgement of “small data” can matter as much as “big data” – for example, addressing a consumer with appropriate gender references.</p> <p><b>Increased payer-provider integration – </b>to<b> </b>close the “care gap” between consumer benefits, care choices, and consumer health care needs. A shift towards care pathways is one emerging trend – management of collective episodes of care, as opposed to disparately managed procedures and treatments. Payer-provider integration at the point of care is also gaining momentum – providing value by streamlining cost transparency and lessening payer, consumer, and provider administrative burdens. One innovation in this area is <a href="http://www.wellero.com/#!home/mainPage">Wellero</a>’s (free) smartphone app, which allows consumers to complete an insurance eligibility check, understand cost before a service is provided, and complete payment at the time of service (eliminating surprise bills). A further evolution to watch for is providers offering their own products on exchanges.</p> <p><b>Predictive and segmentation analytics.</b> Predictive analytics performed against clinical and claims data can proactively contain cost by increasing efficiency and improving health outcomes &#8211; benefitting consumers, providers, and carriers alike. As LexisNexis emphasized, information about the “now” state of patients can be used to identify and proactively treat patients at risk for high-cost services, mitigating health risks while reducing costs. Analytics performed against data about consumer demographics and behaviors can be used to create additional convenience for consumers, while allowing providers and insurers to know who a consumer is and provide appropriate prompts for taking advantage of benefits and care options.</p> <p><b>Value determination and transparency. </b>There is evidence that cost and quality do not necessarily trend upward together – and that consumers tend to rely on higher cost as an indication of higher quality. There is an opportunity to reduce costs for consumers, insurers, and providers by providing consumers with easy-to-use tools for assessing and communicating quality and shopping options.</p> <p><b>Stay agile. </b>Reduce consumer friction by remaining light and agile in the evolution of technology solution. As recommended by Kony, “write once, build everywhere” – to leverage a single code base across different devices. And remember that content is portable. Reuse options can increase the feasibility of maintaining the array of communication channels preferred by various consumer groups.</p> <p>The sessions generally looked past concerns around healthcare.gov, focusing on longer term options for the newly retail-focused industry. We look forward to seeing how these trends and further changes develop through 2014.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurers-time-bring-game-consumers/">Health Insurers: Time to Bring the Game to the Consumers</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the largest payers in the healthcare industry were represented at November’s AHIP Consumer Experience Forum, with keynote speakers and panelists from WellPoint, HCSC, Aetna, and Florida Blue, among others. Rather than recap each session, we are sharing some of the key themes highlighted throughout the conference.</p> <p><strong>Industry-wide Gap in Knowing your Customer</strong><br /> It only makes sense that ‘know your customer’ was reiterated over and over &#8211; after all, how you define this is key to success. Knowing your customer doesn’t only mean creating market segments, personas and journey maps &#8211; that is just a start. Marcus Osborne from Wal-Mart described a 3-month ordeal just to complete a biometric screening. From waiting 2 months for the first available appointment, to learning at that visit that he needed to fast for at least 8 hours, to getting the results a week later, and in the end, not learning anything new from his normal results. To provide a thoughtful and cost effective consumer experience, insurers need to understand all the interactions that can occur at each step along the way.</p> <p><strong>Empathy</strong><br /> One highlight of the conference was hearing Alexandra Drane from Eliza humorously share an anecdote about an unengaging experience with her insurer. Receiving reminder after generic reminder to complete a medical service, she proposed that her insurer, “Send me a letter followed by a phone call. Let me know you are listening….” Knowing your customer is one thing, but this needs to be augmented by awareness of the nuanced situations and feelings the customer may have around each interaction. The consumer wants to know that you are listening and that you understand their circumstances. Empathy is essential to an amazing consumer engagement strategy.</p> <p><strong>Test and Retest</strong><br /> This is easier said than done, but the basic message is that we should continually work towards improving the user experience. Multiple speakers brought up Amazon, and how they constantly tweak their website. A/B testing is a big factor in Amazon’s success. Pilot testing should be done more often. Test, apply learnings, and repeat…multiple times.  And remember that employer groups and brokers are consumers too.</p> <p><strong>Consumerism</strong><br /> Certainly one of the buzzwords of the conference, one speaker defined consumerism as ‘changing operations to meet and exceed customer expectations’. This includes having an effectively functioning website. One example: Ingrid Lindberg from Prime Therapeutics shared that it takes 3 clicks for their customers to navigate to the appropriate plan, versus HealthCare.gov, which takes up to 41 clicks.</p> <p><strong>Big Data Replaced by Good Data</strong><br /> It was nice to hear quite a few speakers prioritize ‘Good Data’ over ‘Big Data’. Taking a close look at the data you get today, do you trust the source of that data? How are you addressing your back end systems to validate that data? Before even considering a Big Data strategy, fix your current data sources and determine the best uses for that data – only then should you think about investing in Big Data.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-takeaways-ahip-consumer-engagement-forum/">5 Takeaways from the AHIP Consumer Experience Forum</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Some might tell you that SharePoint can meet all your corporate collaboration and information needs, and that it is the answer to world peace. Some will say that SharePoint is simply “skin” and provides limited core business value.</p> <p>When it comes to Business Intelligence (BI), we need t
]]>
<![CDATA[
o step away from the fanaticism of either argument. Here’s what we do know: <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2340216" target="_blank">Gartner</a> shows BI as the fastest growing software segment, with 7% growth in 2013 and overall revenue of $13.8B, and growth expected to continue to over $17B by 2016. There are a number of very specialized players in the space that have poured investment and expertise into this area.</p> <p>So why are users still clamoring for more, better, timelier information? It is not because the data is not available. Of the organizations that we work with, most already have effective ways of capturing the core information that influences their business. Further, many organizations are relatively proficient at managing that information in structured chunks. Where is the disconnect?</p> <p>The holy grail of IT used to be “getting the right information, to the right people at the right time” and in this case, the information is there, it is structured, and it is available. However, the information is not accessible in a useable way.<b> </b><a title="Big Data! Fast Data! Usable Data?" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/big-data-fast-data-usable-data/" target="_blank">Usability</a> is so often overlooked in IT projects, it is almost a cliché. IT projects at the nexus of providing business information directly to end-users have traditionally struggled because the focus has been on making the technology work, rather than making the information work for the user.</p> <p>SharePoint may not be the proverbial Swiss Army knife of software, but it has one huge advantage in the BI space. Business users are comfortable interacting with information displayed through the SharePoint/Microsoft medium. Some BI experts claim that “Excel runs the world” and it is interesting how much information is ultimately distilled down to Excel for consumption, even after substantial investments have been made in BI technology – but that is more of a symptom. The problem for most organizations is information overload. SharePoint lets us make data digestible and relevant to the business users, allowing them to interact with and manipulate information through interfaces they are already comfortable with.</p> <p><a title="SAP to SharePoint: Delivering Business Intelligence Reporting" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sap-to-sharepoint-delivering-business-intelligence-reporting/" target="_blank">One of our clients</a> recently ran into this issue. They had invested significant capital and resources in their current ERP, and the vendor was pushing them to buy more software to expand BI functionality and increase usability. This client also had SharePoint, which was used within departments but not considered an Enterprise-ready application. Tahoe helped our client keep a single version of the truth, leveraging SharePoint to make information accessible and useful to their users. Based on the success of the original SharePoint BI reporting project, this client is now building on this foundation and implementing Microsoft’s Performance Point BI technology. By keeping the ETL with the ERP, the client negated the risk of multiple versions of the data, while at the same time increasing the availability and trustworthiness of the information they were already collecting. SharePoint provided the customer with imaging tools that business users needed to better interact with and ultimately interpret data, without increasing licensing costs.</p> <p>Are we saying the world <i>should </i>run on Excel? No. Our core belief is that people use tools that they find useful and, yes, enjoyable. When it comes to technology, the new reality is that corporate technology needs to be as usable as what is available in the consumer market. SharePoint helps companies to bridge this gap without adding undue cost or complexity.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-viable-business-intelligence-tool/">Is SharePoint a Viable Business Intelligence Tool?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>In my almost-30 years in consulting, I have preached, expounded upon, and lived through wave after wave of ideas and approaches to driving business forward, with the ultimate hope of impacting bottom line results: cost reduction, right sizing, business process reengineering, reverse engineering, business process transformation, and innovation (again).</p> <p>All these efforts, in one form or another, had the primary goal of changing the way people worked in order to produce a more efficient and effective environment that matched or exceeded the expectations of the customer (whether that customer was internal or external). We challenged everything:</p> <ul> <li>Customers (macro, micro, targets, outliers)</li> <li>Outcomes (spoken/unspoken requirements)</li> <li>Business rules (guiding principles, sacred cows, performance measures)</li> <li>Business processes (workflows, activities, tasks)</li> <li>Information (data definition, structures, ownership)</li> <li>Technology (hardware, software,, infrastructure)</li> <li>Organization (centralized, decentralized, functional, matrix)</li> <li>Resources (quality, quantity)</li> <li>Culture (attitudes, beliefs, customs)</li> </ul> <p>Looking back, some of these approaches worked better than others, but in the end it was (and still is!) about aligning all of these elements to effectively collaborate within and outside of the enterprise to produce real value at an acceptable rate of investment.</p> <p>I believe the time is right to capture and realize the benefits and value espoused by these various approaches. At Tahoe Partners, we call this sought-after state the NowEnterprise- not so much a solution as an environment for radically changing the way people engage and collaborate. All the elements for effective engagement and collaboration are aligning:</p> <ul> <li>Users’ expectations, demands and adoption levels have been radically redefined by an increasingly connected world. Today’s new workforce (and consumer) has only operated in a world where the internet exists!</li> <li>Organizational and business process barriers (i.e. structures) are overcome or worked around by the continuous and ever growing use of private and/or social networks to gain access to the right people and information.</li> <li>Transaction based systems have been optimized. Technology is now focused on systems of engagement – users of business technology expect their computing environments to match the power and simplicity of the consumer tools that they use in everyday life.</li> </ul> <p>We are no longer discussing how to streamline and optimize one component or another. We are designing and implementing a holistic user experience that match situational needs – regardless of whether that experience is to be realized by a customer, staff member, partner or supplier.</p> <p>The personal ‘aha’ for me is that the time is NOW to radically change the way we engage and collaborate &#8211; I know this to be true, as I see it happening here at Tahoe. It is not the result of a management dictum, but a natural evolution expedited by the availability of enabling technologies, the desire and expectation of our workforce to openly communicate and collaborate, and the willingness of our entire team to embrace change in order to deliver high quality solutions. It is truly about the full experience.</p> <p>Change is never easy, but what an exciting time to be a part of it….</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-different-time-around/">Enterprise Collaboration: Why it’s Different this time Around</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>A week after President Obama’s announcement that insurance companies can continue to offer existing non-ACA-compliant plans (set to expire at the end of 2013) for an additional year, many barriers still remain. First and foremost, individual state insurance commissioners must allow insurers within their state to extend those policies. Without insurance commissioner approval, insurance companies cannot comply with the president’s request. State insurance commissioners in Washington and Arkansas have already announced that they do not plan to implement the changes, with other states set to make a decision shortly.</p> <p>Insurance commissioners and insurance companies are reluctant to make this change for many reasons. Insurers have put forth significant time and effort to communicate the initial expiration to customers. With only six weeks until the January 1<sup>st</sup> deadline, they would need to craft an entirely new set of communications to their members. In addition, there may be backend system requirements, as well as adjustments to strategic marketing efforts, that would be difficult to execute within this timeframe. With many companies trying to reduce costs, confusion over options may prompt an increase in customer support calls. Some commissioners and insurers feel that it is too late in the game to change course.</p> <p>However, the most significant reason that few are keen to implement the extension has to do with the risk pool. Insurers rely on a large number of healthy individuals to counterbalance the cost of those who may be older and/or sicker. Plans are priced to reflect premiums from healthy individual offsetting the cost of treating the sick. That is one factor in increased plan prices this year, as insurers anticipated an influx of sicker individuals obtaining insurance through the exchange. If insurance companies continue to offer these cheaper, bare bones plans, they risk having to spend more than they collect in premiums. This in turn could cause 2015 premiums to be more expensive across the board.</p> <p>Given the uncertainty of the impact of extending non-ACA-compliant policies on consumers, insurance companies and the overall health insurance market, insurance commissioners are approaching the change with caution. Commissioners want to make sure that consumers are protected, and insurers need to be sure they will be able to cover their members without a loss. Ultimately, this decision is about far more than “if you like your plan, you can keep it.” Insurance commissioners are tasked with determining whether allowing the extension for this select group of individual consumers outweighs the threat of an unstable risk pool.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/aca-update-insurance-commissioners-weigh-individual-benefit-threat-unstable-risk-pool/">ACA Update: Insurance Commissioners Weigh Individual Benefit Against Unstable Risk Pool</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>With President Obama’s recent directive to insurers to continue to offer existing individual plans, if state insurance commissioners approve a one-year extension of non-ACA-compliant plans, the burden will fall on health insurers to educate consumers on their current options.</p> <p>Communication will be essential to ensuring that the transition goes smoothly, particularly since there has been (and will continue to be) a plethora of questions as to what the extension of existing non-ACA compliant policies means for policyholders. Many members may have already made choices based on new regulations (such as keeping children under 26 on their policy), and it may not be clear to them what is applicable when keeping an existing policy. According to the president, insurance companies will likely be required to send out a letter highlighting the benefits missing from their current policies, as well as provide guidance around comparable ACA-compliant plans.</p> <p>To proactively assist consumers through the process of deciding whether to keep their existing plan or select a new one, insurers should also, at a minimum, include:</p> <ol> <li>Why the option to keep their current plan is being offered.</li> <li>What this option means and what it doesn’t; for example, can you switch from one extended policy to another?</li> <li>What steps to take to renew their existing plan.</li> <li>Where they can request or access more information.</li> </ol> <p>This information should also be available on the insurer’s retail portal. Given the short timeframe, it may not be possible to fully integrate shopping, comparison and purchase options; many companies may opt to provide microsites for individuals who wish to learn more about keeping their existing plans. Minimally, this information should be offered as an FAQ.</p> <p>Finally, we expect that this change will generate a large call volume from members who not only have general questions, but specific concerns related to their policy. Insurance companies should provide the appropriate training to their customer service team, and prepare to increase staffing if there is a significant increase in call volume.</p> <p>Even if this policy extension fails to materialize, opening and maintaining the lines of communication with affected members is essential. By providing essential information and clearing up misconceptions, insurers have an opportunity to establish themselves as a trusted partner at a critical time.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/aca-update-insurer-communication-key-extending-existing-policies/">ACA Update: Insurer Communication Key to Policy Change</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>President Obama announced Thursday a proposed change to the Affordable Care Act that will allow health insurance companies to provide one-year extensions on existing individual plans – even if they are not ACA-compliant. What does this mean for health insurers?</p> <p>First, any changes need to be passed by state insurance commissioners. Already, there seems to be reluctance from this group, citing potential market impact, as well as the fact that these changes have already been put in motion (as anyone who has received a letter of cancellation can attest). Altering course now introduces significant risks. You can read the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) press release <a title="NAIC News Release" href="http://www.naic.org/Releases/2013_docs/naic_president_obama_one_year_extension_existing_plans.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>If and when approved by state insurance commissioners, health insurers would be able to continue offering existing non-ACA-compliant insurance plans. According to the president, those insurers who extend existing plans will be required to notify individual consumers in writing &#8211; specifying which benefits their current policy does not offer, and directing them to new, comparable ACA-compliant plans. It will then be up to the consumer to decide whether they wish to retain their existing policy or purchase a new one.</p> <p>What today’s statement means is still an unclear. Foremost among many unanswered questions &#8211; will premiums for these existing policies skyrocket, as insurance companies try to balance the risk with new high-risk members?</p> <p>In the next few days, we hope to hear more from President Obama and the NAIC, with further details on what this announcement means, and how best to implement this significant change to the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/major-aca-revision-prompts-questions-confusion-insurers/">Major ACA Revision Prompts Questions, Confusion for Insurers</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Next week, AHIP kicks off the <b>Operations and Technology Forum</b> in Chicago. This year’s forum promises to be especially interesting following the debut of open enrollment for direct health insurance coverage on October 1<sup>st</sup> – and the HealthCare.gov debacle.  Sessions will cover timely topics for health care payers, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Operational challenges with the advent of marketplaces</li> <li>Personalized customer engagement</li> <li>Redefining strategies for managing costs and handling payments in the post-reform environment</li> <li>Multi-channel customer outreach</li> </ul> <p>Immediately following will be part three of the <b>AHIP Customer Experience Forum series -</b> focusing on strategies to enhance direct-to-consumer marketing, as shared by industry leaders in retail, data analytics, and consumer behavior. As health care reform transforms health insurance processes, can these sessions provide clarity around the most effective next steps for outreach to the community of uninsureds? With the rich offering of channels now available (including mobile, big data, social media), will these discussions inspire new ways to align payer resources with consumer needs? And will carrier discussions outside of sessions perhaps be more telling than the sessions themselves?</p> <p>We are especially interested in carrier response to presentation topics – including Steven Brill’s “<b>Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us</b>”, Mike Flanagan’s “<b>We’re on the Exchange, Now What?</b>”, and “<b>Turning Reform into Transform</b>”, presented by LexisNexis.</p> <p>From our experience working with our clients following the October 1<sup>st</sup> launch of open enrollment, we know that options to bolster consumer confidence around applications for cost sharing options and enrollment are foremost concerns.</p> <p>Stay tuned. We will be tweeting from the AHIP forums (<a title="@tahoepartners" href="https://twitter.com/tahoepartners" target="_blank">@tahoepartners</a>) with insights into these key topics and more. Please let us know if you will be attending – we’d love the opportunity to catch up face to face and share ideas, thoughts, and experiences. <strong>RSVP here!</strong></p> [contact-form] <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/the-future-is-the-consumer-at-ahips-november-conference/">The Future is the Consumer at AHIP’s November Conference</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

sses, and improved adoption. Gains like these are often referred to as “soft” or “intangible” and though they’re equally significant, it is critical that we also look at the quantitative returns realized when making a SharePoint investment.</p> <p>We recently completed a Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) application for a major global supplier of facilities and industrial maintenance products. This solution unified enterprise data by pulling customer and contract information from SAP and joining it with contract milestone and addendum information stored in SharePoint. It provided insight into critical business processes by allowing the sales and CLM teams to see milestone data, contract status, and approval bottlenecks in the pipeline. And of course, adoption improved as users began working inside our user-friendly custom interface instead of a difficult-to-navigate SAP interface. Before the pilot ended, these “soft” returns turned into major tangible gains:</p> <ul> <li>100% compliance in aligning customer need to the right solution <ul> <li>Before moving to SharePoint, the CLM process was unstructured; necessary steps in contract negotiations were missed due to lack of insight into approval and negotiation status. As a result, contracts didn’t meet customer needs, resulting in consequences ranging from reduction in terms to actual customer abandonment.</li> <li>After moving to SharePoint, contracts were 100% aligned with customer need. Although the client still sees some renegotiation of terms, it is not because of mistakes or faults in the process. Further, when needed, renegotiation details are now tracked in SharePoint and completely visible to both sales and the CLM team.</li> </ul> </li> <li>40% reduction in contract/agreement closing time <ul> <li>Working with an efficient and responsive partner is a big win for customer satisfaction.</li> <li>A 40% reduction in closing time unblocks the pipeline for additional contracts to be managed, negotiated, and ultimately signed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Put simply, satisfied customers, receiving accurate contracts that provide the services they need, sign faster and more often than dissatisfied customers receiving erroneous and untimely documents. Ultimately, the CLM solution led to an increased number of signatures and speed to revenue.</p> <p>What’s great to see is that benefits like these aren’t tied to a specific industry. Looking at another lifecycle management LOB application – Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) – in the food and beverage industry, we see similar quantitative gains driving increased savings and launch to market (i.e. increased profits), including: improved visibility into approvals, costing, supply chain management, and the pricing process. For this specific system, we focused not only on data unification, but also employee unification – successfully bringing employees working across a large number of disparate operations together under a single system and process. Again, these intangibles immediately turned into hard numbers:</p> <ul> <li>90% reduction in transportation costing turn-around</li> <li>50% decrease in time-to approvals</li> </ul> <p>These huge gains turned into delivering product to market 30 days faster! Pardon the redundancy, but again, decreased time to completion (by 50–90 percent) turns into more product available to customers, and increased sales and revenue.</p> <p>There are both qualitative and quantitative gains to be had when implementing critical business processes in SharePoint, and the two are often intrinsically tied to one another. Be sure to take the time to analyze both sides of the equation to maximize ROI for the platform and your efforts implementing the process &#8211; the net result often means increased revenue and/or profit.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/lifecycle-management-sharepoint-lob-solutions/">Lifecycle Management SharePoint LOB Solutions</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Have you been tasked with setting up a new SharePoint 2013 environment, or do you want to verify that your existing farm has all the necessary components in place? In this post, we take a look at three core SharePoint 2013 service applications required for a fully functioning farm, and how they can be provisioned via the <a title="Use Windows PowerShell to administer SharePoint 2013" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee806878.aspx" target="_blank">SharePoint 2013 Management Shell</a>. All the service applications discussed below are available in both the standard and enterprise editions of SharePoint Server 2013, and are recommended to be provisioned in your SharePoint 2013 farm via PowerShell.</p> <p>If you’re working with a brand new farm, you will likely need an initial application pool for your service apps. If so, you can use the following command to get a default application pool up and running. Microsoft recommends running all of your service applications from a single application pool, unless your requirements dictate the need for separation.</p> <pre style="border: 1px solid black;">New-SPServiceApplicationPool –Name “Your Default Service Application Pool 
 Name” –Account “Domain\ServiceAppPoolAccount”</pre> <p><strong>State Service Application</strong><br /> The State Service Application is often overlooked by SharePoint administrators. It is a common source of errors in the server application logs when missing from the farm. As the name implies, this service application maintains <i>state</i> for user sessions and many out of the box features. The following command can be used to provision the State Service Application from within the SharePoint 2013 Management Shell:</p> <pre style="border: 1px solid black;">New-SPStateServiceDatabase -Name "State_Service_DB" | New-SPStateServiceApplication -Name "State Service Application" | New-SPStateServiceApplicationProxy –DefaultProxyGroup</pre> <p>After provisioning the State Service Application, visit the “Manage Service Applications” page in Central Administration to verify the service application is listed. Additional information on provisioning the State Service Application can be found <a title="New-SPStateServiceApplication" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff608084.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Usage and Health Data Collection Service Application</strong><br /> If you want to know the health and status of your SharePoint farm, you need to get this service application up and running. Unlike the Web Analytics Service Application from SharePoint 2010, this version needs to be provisioned from the SharePoint 2013 Management Shell:</p> <pre style="border: 1px solid black;">New-SPUsageApplication –Name “Usage and Health Data Service Application”
 
 $proxy = Get-SPServiceApplicationProxy | where {$_.TypeName –eq “Usage and Health Data Service Application Proxy”}
 
 $proxy.Provision()</pre> <p>After provisioning the Usage and Health Data Collection Service Application, visit the “Manage Service Applications” page in Central Administration to verify the service application is listed and for additional configuration. Additional information on configuring usage and health data collection is available <a title="Configure usage and health data collection in SharePoint 2013" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee663480.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Subscription Settings Service Application</strong><br /> This is likely an unfamiliar service application for many SharePoint administrators, as it was primarily used for multi-tenant scenarios in SharePoint 2010. In SharePoint 2013, the Subscription Settings Service Application is now required for the new<a title="Configure an environment for apps for SharePoint (SharePoint 2013)" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161236.aspx" target="_blank"> App Management</a> service to be fully functional and should be provisioned regardless of a multi-tenancy scenario. (If you’re on SharePoint 2013, you will want to use Apps!) The following commands can be used to provision the Subscription Settings Service Application:</p> <pre style="border: 1px solid black;">$sa = New-SPSubscriptionSettingsServiceApplication –ApplicationPool “Your Default Service Application Pool Name” –Name “Subscription Settings Service Application” –DatabaseName “Subscription_Settings_Service_DB”
 
 New-SPSubscriptionSettingsServiceApplicationProxy –ServieApplication $sa
 
 Get-SPServiceInstance | where {$_.TypeName –eq “Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Subscription Settings Service”} | Start-SPServiceInstance</pre> <p>After provisioning the Subscription Settings Service Application, visit the “Manage Service Applications” page in Central Administration to verify the service application is listed and for additional configuration. Additional information on configuring the Subscription Settings Service Application can be found <a title="Prepare your SharePoint 2013 farm for App development and debugging" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/how24/archive/2013/06/14/prepare-your-sharepoint-2013-farm-for-app-development-and-debugging.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-core-service-applications/">SharePoint 2013 Core Service Applications</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Deterred by the technical issues surrounding HealthCare.gov, many uninsured individuals are taking a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach to health insurance. Insurers can tap into this market of under-served shoppers by <a title="HealthCare.gov has Silver Lining for Insurers" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/healthcare-gov-has-silver-lining-for-insurers/" target="_blank">becoming a source of reliable and available information</a> on the new health law.

<![CDATA[
<p>A <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/2/304.full">2010 study by Harvard health economists</a> reported that for every $1 invested in workplace wellness programs, there is an average return of $3 in health care cost savings over a three-year period, achieved through reduced medical care costs and absenteeism. In addition, a <a title="Workplace Wellness Programs Study" href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/workplacewellnessstudyfinal.pdf" target="_blank">joint study between the U.S. Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services</a> reported a similar ratio &#8211; that every 1% of medical costs invested in a wellness program results in up to a 3% return in savings. However, some experts question the use of ROI to measure the success of a workplace wellness program. When you consider the wide variety of organizations, the types of labor involved and the availability of data, it’s difficult to determine if an investment in wellness automatically equates to 300% savings.</p> <p>Dr. Ron Goetzel, Director of the Emory University Institute for Health and Productivity Studies, stated earlier this year, <a href="http://welcoa.org/freeresources/pdf/rongoetzel011912.pdf">“A more realistic ROI estimate is probably in the neighborhood of 2:1 as opposed to 3:1.&#8221;</a> Harvard’s study may not fully account for increased employer costs during the first year a program is implemented &#8211; a result of employees learning they are high risk for certain conditions and seeking medical attention to address these risks.</p> <p>There is significant data supporting health &amp; wellness programs in the workplace, and most research agrees that wellness programs do work. There are even provisions for health and wellness programs in the Affordable Care Act. So, how do health insurers leverage the cost savings associated with wellness initiatives?</p> <p>Current trends point toward integrating member benefits and health and wellness into one seamless solution; for example, a member portal that shows how their biometric screening results and annual physical tie into their health assessment, or how their new prescription ties to related preventative articles and rewardable activities. By making wellness initiatives a fundamental part of a comprehensive health care program, insurers can pave the way for the <a title="Don’t Wait for your Customers to Call You" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-wait-for-your-customers-to-call-you/" target="_blank">next phase in care management</a> and reduced health-related costs.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/finding-savings-in-health-wellness-programs/">Finding Savings in Health &#038; Wellness Programs</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

nagement lifecycle &#8211; from innovation to production – can provide a competitive advantage. This is true even if it is only feasible to make incremental improvements.</p> <p>As part of our ongoing series on SharePoint Line of Business Applications, we’re looking at two of our recent projects – one where only a portion of the lifecycle was addressed, and one that drastically improved the end-to-end process. As we noted in our post on the <a title="3 Key ROI Benefits of SharePoint Line of Business Applications" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/3-key-roi-benefits-of-sharepoint-line-of-business-applications/" target="_blank">ROI benefits of SharePoint Line of Business Applications</a>, SharePoint can be a powerful tool to improve product management efficiency, either as a standalone solution or integrated into an enterprise LOB application.</p> <p>Our client, a consumer packaged goods company in the food and beverage vertical, sought to improve their innovation process – managed mostly by spreadsheets on individual computers and over email or phone. Leadership had little visibility to the number of projects in the innovation queue, or the status of those projects. Further, the innovation process itself had issues that required lots of cycling between key personnel to ensure all the right information was available and to keep the product/idea moving to formal approval.</p> <p>Using SharePoint, we set up a product approval process to ensure the right information was in place before a project could move from one stage to another, eliminating inefficiencies.  Additionally, we added features that provided reminders and escalations if items were not moving through the process within a predetermined timeframe. Management could see the progress of each individual item, as well as reports on key metrics.</p> <p>This system provided a framework to quickly identify opportunities and eliminate redundancies in the product lifecycle &#8211; significantly decreasing the time spent taking a product from an idea to the shelf. In total, they were able to reduce some process times by as much as 90%, and the overall approval process by 50%.</p> <p>Our next client, a producer of custom cups with customer logos and artwork, wanted to expand their market to include smaller industry players, while at the same time decreasing standard turnaround time by more than 75%. Their existing process involved an inefficient design approval process, tedious production setup, and manual cost approvals.</p> <p>We implemented a solution that leveraged state-of-the-art visualization tools, giving their sales force the ability to demonstrate what a finished product would look like – including the client’s artwork &#8211; so that approvals could be obtained on the spot. This eliminated the back and forth previously required to approve designs. In addition, we developed the backend workflow associated with approvals, feeding into the company’s SAP system to set up and schedule the production of custom cups. To eliminate inefficiencies due to bad data, the system also validated data throughout the process.</p> <p>This effort led to significant gains in speed to delivery – for example, the interval between order placement and approval of production set-up was reduced from <b>weeks</b> to<b> less than 5 minutes</b>. Such improvements in time from order placement to final delivery allowed them to expand their product offerings to organizations requiring a more agile partner.</p> <p>By implementing smart technologies to improve manual, inefficient processes, each of these organizations saw significant improvements in their speed to market, ultimately leading to a better product offering and capitalization of the market.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-lob-applications-smart-technology-product-management/">SharePoint LOB Applications: Smart Technology for Product Management</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>What is the difference between an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and a SharePoint Strategy? Which do you need?</p> <p>Our recent series of blog posts outlined the <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap</a> and examined specific elements of a strong strategy, such as the <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-the-right-technology-foundation/">technology foundation</a>, <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-content-and-search-are-key/">content and search</a>, <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-user-experience-and-change-resilient-design/">user experience</a>, and <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-governance-training-communication-for-better-enterprise-collaboration/">governance, training and communication</a>. Where does a SharePoint Strategy fit in?</p> <p><b>IT&#8217;S ALL ABOUT FOCUS</b><br /> The primary distinction between an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and a SharePoint Strategy lies in the focus. An Enterprise Collaboration Strategy looks at the major platforms and programs used for collaboration across the enterprise. This includes areas like audio and web conferencing, unified communications (instant messaging and phones), video conference, file sharing tools, internal and external social networking tools, applications that contain document management capabilities, and more. And of course, it often includes SharePoint.</p> <p>A SharePoint Strategy focuses specifically on SharePoint; how it is used, how it <em>could</em> be used, how the user experience can be improved, how to increase adoption, and more. Other enterprise tools will be uncovered and discussed in terms of their impact to SharePoint, but are not evaluated to the same depth they might be in an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy.</p> <p>Both Enterprise Collaboration and SharePoint Strategies cover these areas:</p> <ul> <li>Communication and Change Management</li> <li>Governance</li> <li>Resources</li> <li>Social</li> <li>Usability and User Experience</li> </ul> <p>For a complete list, see our post on <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">what we look at in an enterprise collaboration strategy</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/EC-vs-SP-Strategy.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1479" alt="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy, SharePoint Strategy" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/EC-vs-SP-Strategy.png" width="657" height="305" /></a></p> <p><b>IT IS NOT BLACK AND</b> <b>WHITE</b><br /> An Enterprise Collaboration Strategy defines an optimized collaboration environment, often anchored by SharePoint, while a SharePoint Strategy defines how SharePoint can be optimally used in the organization.</p> <p>It is not possible to create an effective SharePoint strategy without gaining a basic understanding of some of the other tools and platforms used for collaborative purposes. It&#8217;s essential to determine what they do well (and should continue to do), versus those requirements that could be better handled by SharePoint.</p> <p>We often execute Enterprise Collaboration Strategies with a strong focus on SharePoint, and additional consideration given to other collaboration tools in the environment. In practice, your specific situation dictates whether an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy or a SharePoint Strategy is best for your organization – and we can help determine which is right for you.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-strategy-vs-enterprise-collaboration-strategy/">SharePoint Strategy vs. Enterprise Collaboration Strategy</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>SharePoint is often regarded simply as a set of sites that house web pages and document libraries. Just below the surface, however, there are dozens of out-of-the-box web parts that demonstrate how far SharePoint extends beyond those capabilities. Business users can build powerful filter web parts, InfoPath forms, Access Apps, custom Search parts, and more. The story doesn’t end there – SharePoint is an enterprise ready solution platform, and it is intended to host and deliver your critical line of business solutions.</p> <p>At Tahoe, we spend a lot of time thinking about SharePoint as a Line of Business (LOB) application platform. We are constantly looking for creative ways to leverage SharePoint’s workflow, business intelligence, search, Business Connectivity Services (<a title="Overview of Business Connectivity Services in SharePoint 2013" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee661740.aspx" target="_blank">BCS</a>), and other features that facilitate critical business processes &#8211; presented through a rich, web-based user experience. We’re proud of <a title="Tahoe Partners Selected to Microsoft Business Critical SharePoint Program" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tahoe-partners-selected-to-microsoft-business-critical-sharepoint-program-224208711.html" target="_blank">our recent selection to the Microsoft Business Critical SharePoint Program</a>, but what really gets us excited are the results we help our clients achieve.</p> <p>In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the key returns you might realize by using SharePoint as a platform to host LOB applications, including Unification, Transparency, and Adoption.</p> <p><strong>Unification through SharePoint LOB Solutions</strong><br /> When you implement LOB solutions in SharePoint, you open the gates to unifying and sharing enterprise data and to coalescing LOB applications themselves. Today, your line of business solutions may consist of standalone .NET applications, SAP modules, powerful Excel workbooks, rogue Access databases, and more. That’s quite a few unique solutions, with each of them hoarding their data.</p> <p>SharePoint is designed to bring all of these critical data stores into one place so users aren’t replicating processes, duplicating data, and learning multiple systems. The .NET applications’ SQL stores and SAP data can be brought into SharePoint through <a title="SharePoint 2013 in the Cloud" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Business Connectivity Services</a>; the Excel workbook can be stored, viewed, and edited right from SharePoint; and the Access database can be ditched and rebuilt for the enterprise as an Access App.</p> <p>With all of the data available in SharePoint, you have a single source of the [data] truth, and can begin building other applications that leverage this master data from within the SharePoint web boundary.</p> <p><strong>Transparency through SharePoint LOB Solutions</strong><br /> <i>Why is it taking so long to move logistics plans through Supply Chain Planning? Who is holding up approval on this new product line?</i></p> <p>The insight you gain into critical business processes by moving your LOB solutions into SharePoint is substantial, and the returns are often immediate. SharePoint is a natural fit for handling tasks and approvals, as well as a powerful platform on which to implement workflows.</p> <p>If you’re managing tasks in SharePoint, you can see who owns them, how many and when they were created, and when they were completed. A range of features (from list views to Performance Point dashboards) allows for concise reporting and visualization of data. You may figure out that you need another resource in Supply Chain Planning because one person can’t handle the volume of tasks created each day. The next thing you know, time to deliver Supply Chain adjustments drops 70%, enabling the transport of more product to market.</p> <p>SharePoint also features approval workflows right out of the box, and when needed you can build custom workflows with .NET and in Azure to do just about anything you can imagine. With approvals automated in SharePoint, you can monitor, send out reminders, reassign, and delegate &#8211; and metrics regarding ownership, time to completion, quarterly turn-over, etc. will be there for you to mine.</p> <p><strong>Adoption through SharePoint LOB Solutions</strong><br /> <a title="Tahoe Partners Selected to Microsoft Business Critical SharePoint Program" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tahoe-partners-selected-to-microsoft-business-critical-sharepoint-program-224208711.html" target="_blank">To quote our CEO</a>, <a title="Ray Conrad" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/author/blog_rconrad/" target="_blank">Ray Conrad</a>, “[Technology must enable] organizations [to] meet the expectations of their customers, employees, partners and suppliers, with progressive solutions that match the power and simplicity of consumer tools. Think robust, personalized, and mobile.” Great user experience increases adoption significantly, and <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: User Experience and Change Resilient Design" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-user-experience-and-change-resilient-design/" target="_blank">UX and Design are among our core competencies</a>.</p> <p>Moving solutions into SharePoint, you can build interfaces that are just as Ray described…powerful and simple. Further, they can be endlessly elegant as SharePoint 2013 adopts the latest in web development technologies. With this approach, users end up working with business tools that are as familiar and seamless as their favorite web site. When functionality is intuitive, you decrease cognitive friction, leading to reduced user abandonment.</p> <p>SharePoint isn’t always the correct place to implement and integrate your LOB solutions, but it is definitely a first class citizen in this space, and should be considered as a top choice for your enterprise. We’ve found opportunities to improve unification, gain insight and transparency, and increase adoption when driving LOB solutions and processes through SharePoint. In the end, these gains turn into a true return on investment for the platform.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/3-key-roi-benefits-of-sharepoint-line-of-business-applications/">3 Key ROI Benefits of SharePoint Line of Business Applications</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Almost three weeks since its launch and HealthCare.gov is still at a sputter. Will the clouds ever part? Will the applications begin to fly? Will my 60-year-old mother stop overusing the word ‘glitchy’?</p> <p>Dare I say, yes. And in the interim, opportunities abound for insurance providers.</p> <p><strong>Establish Yourself as a Credible Source</strong><br /> Consumers are starved for information on reform, and they aren’t getting any help from HealthCare.gov. Savvy carriers are proactively reaching out to the market to promote their digital properties as destinations for reliable (and available) information. Some of the more effective draws have been <i>Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) estimators</i>. Insurers who invested in building proprietary APTC calculators are offering consumers an opportunity to window shop for plans and understand ballpark pricing. These carriers are filling their pipeline with real, near-term leads that they can nurture until HealthCare.gov is fully operational.</p> <p><strong>Be Helpful</strong><br /> Instead of enabling their frustration, why not start a service that keeps consumers information on the status of HealthCare.gov, letting them know when it’s safe to go back into the water. Within the industry, we will continue to pound on the door, and will likely be the first to know when critical glitches have been fixed. A simple communications campaign could go a long way in establishing consumer relationships.</p> <p><strong>Watch Your Step</strong><br /> One word of caution: many insurance carriers have links to HealthCare.gov from their existing digital properties, put there by UX professionals who expected the Exchanges to be up and running. You may want to rethink how you redirect consumers to HealthCare.gov. The reality is, if a shopper gets frustrated, they aren’t coming back to your site. For example, one client decided to reroute all online traffic to the call center instead of to HealthCare.gov &#8211; giving them an opportunity to have a real conversation with the consumer.</p> <p>The first weeks of open enrollment have been frustrating for all involved. But there is a silver lining &#8211; and those insurance carriers that find it will be much better off in the months to come.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/healthcare-gov-has-silver-lining-for-insurers/">HealthCare.gov has Silver Lining for Insurers</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

After all, collaboration is defined as “working with another person or group in order to achieve or do something.” That sounds social &#8211; doesn’t it?</p> <p>For the last several months we’ve outlined our approach to <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmaps</a> and discussed details in areas from <a title="SharePoint Governance, Training &amp; Communication for Better Enterprise Collaboration" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-governance-training-communication-for-better-enterprise-collaboration/" target="_blank">governance, training and communication</a>, to <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: User Experience and Change Resilient Design" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-user-experience-and-change-resilient-design/" target="_blank">user experience and usability</a>, to making sure you have the <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: the Right Technology Foundation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-the-right-technology-foundation/" target="_blank">right technology foundation</a> in place. This final piece in our series will dig into social and mobile as factors in an Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap.</p> <p><b>WHAT IS SOCIAL, ANYWAY?</b><br /> In the enterprise, social and social business mean different things to different people. Every organization is at a different level of social maturity, and readiness to embrace social capabilities. In creating an Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap, we look at a wide range of social capabilities, as well as cultural issues that may impact a social strategy and adoption. Topics include:</p> <ul> <li>Is the culture receptive to modern social business capabilities? What are some foreseeable obstacles? What level of change management will be needed?</li> <li>How do employees find subject matter experts?</li> <li>What information is contained in an employee’s profile? Are skills, projects, hobbies, areas of expertise, etc. included?</li> <li>Are wikis and blogs used? Are they highly adopted across the organization?</li> <li>How can online communities be used to facilitate more efficient interaction between individuals with a common purpose?</li> <li>Would newsfeed type functionality be valuable?</li> <li>Can users rate, follow, tag or highlight content?</li> <li>How is ideation performed? Would crowdsourcing improve the quality and number of ideas?</li> <li>What type of recognition programs are in place? Can the Enterprise Collaboration environment be leveraged?</li> <li>Are users using “external” social tools for business purposes, such as Yammer, Jive, LinkedIn, etc., that run the risk of exposing confidential information?</li> </ul> <p><b>COLLABORATION REQUIRES MOBILE</b><br /> In a previous post, &#8220;<a title="Social and Mobile must be part of ALL Digital Solutions" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/social-and-mobile-must-be-part-of-all-digital-solutions/" target="_blank">Social and Mobile must be part of ALL Digital Solutions</a>&#8220;, we discussed how mobile (and social) must be part of any solution. This applies to an Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap as well – mobile must be a significant consideration in all areas of the roadmap.  Like social, mobile often has different meanings which we explore through questions like:</p> <ul> <li>How are employees in the field collaborating with each other?</li> <li>What information, processes, and applications do remote users require?</li> <li>What content is accessed on each type of device? Phones? Tablets? Laptop?</li> <li>How do tablet and phone users interact with social content? How do they find experts?</li> <li>How can a consistent user experience across all devices provide better usability and higher adoption?</li> <li>Are there strong use cases for <a title="Gartner Summit: The Difference between Apps and Applications" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/gartner-summit-the-difference-between-apps-and-applications/" target="_blank">apps and/or applications</a>? Which is best?</li> <li> <p style="display: inline !important;">What key security considerations are there for mobile?</p> </li> </ul> <p>Understanding where your organization is heading with social and mobile is especially critical because these two areas are rapidly spreading through the enterprise. If they aren’t already, users will soon demand social and mobile capabilities, and those demands will only increase as users have broader online experiences outside of work. Do you have a <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for mobile and social in your company?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-users-demand-social-and-mobile/">Enterprise Users Demand Social and Mobile</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>When we begin to talk about enterprise collaboration, almost every company quickly mentions their challenges with usability and adoption. It’s a common theme because most technology environments grow organically as needs arise, and user experience falls victim to technology transition and business evolution. As we approach a redesign and begin creating an <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration roadmap</a>, we look closely at the current and future challenges of organizational change, and building a ‘change resilient’ design.</p> <p><b>Factors of Organization Change</b></p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GFX-Organization-Change-Factors.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1396" alt="Organization-Change-Factors" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GFX-Organization-Change-Factors.png" width="942" height="245" /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Change Resilient Design</b><br /> A top redesign objective is creating a stable Information Architecture that evolves in an elegant manner, anticipates scale, and is resilient to flux. It begins with a shift in design philosophy: we design navigation for people not companies. Contemporary navigation presents categories by <i>user intention</i> versus <i>organizational silo</i>.</p> <p>Companies often design top-level navigation based on organizational structure – departments, business units, or org charts. This makes the content architecture highly susceptible to change. As a solution, we rethink navigation from the employee’s perspective, tailoring the experience to the individual and to their unique role, supporting how they work. This task-based design results in a more stable content architecture, and an experience that is better suited to performing specific tasks. Navigation can never be all things to all people, but we can tailor views and provide personalization that better meets each user’s unique needs.</p> <p>In planning a roadmap, we consider the various roles, jobs, and departments within your company. The breadth and depth of understanding your enterprise users is a significant factor in scoping budget and timelines. This activity is commonly referred to as <i>User Definition</i>, and it is the foundation for the design process and a key element of improving adoption and productivity. We ask questions like:</p> <ul> <li>How many user types exist within your company?</li> <li>Which are primary versus secondary user groups? (Value to business)</li> <li>What are their working conditions, unique tasks, and content interactions?</li> </ul> <p>Understanding these and other insights will result in a more intelligent design and improved usability. This information can be gathered through interviews and observation; the rigor of this process varies and is a scope consideration. One option is to view the process as iterative, defining users with initial broad strokes and refining the details over time – improving efficiency, adding functionality and tailoring experiences.</p> <p>A tenet of great web design is to view your Intranet as a living, breathing entity. There is no end to the project, only phases and new releases. Build your <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration roadmap</a> with this philosophy in mind, and you will always be adding value, improving performance and gaining adoption.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-user-experience-and-change-resilient-design/">Enterprise Collaboration: User Experience and Change Resilient Design</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>For many health insurers, enticing policyholders to use their member portal site has been both a top priority and a continual challenge. In spite of the wealth of information and tools available, it is difficult to convince members to log in and take advantage of these benefits.</p> <p>It’s time to move beyond relying on email and print campaigns, promotions, and new mobile applications to attract customers to the member portal, and work towards delivering products and services tailored to what’s going on in their world… at exactly the right moment.</p> <p>Imagine a scenario where you receive an email when your child turns fifteen, with tips on teaching your son or daughter to be a responsible driver.  You might see a text message listing the Top 10 things to do when planning to have a baby – triggered by purchasing an ovulation kit with your flexible spending account. Or after moving to a new home, you get an email notification providing a list of in-network, primary care physicians, pharmacies, and health clubs in your new neighborhood.</p> <p>Life events are milestones that are likely to prompt some type of interaction between an individual and their insurance provider. Health insurance related life events include:</p> <ul> <li>Starting a new job</li> <li>Getting married</li> <li>Giving birth or adopting a child</li> <li>Reaching age 26</li> <li>Diagnosis of a serious illness</li> <li>Planning major surgery</li> </ul> <p>These major life events can be a fruitful time to reach out to consumers. The key is utilizing the data that is already available to your organization in a way that feels helpful, not intrusive. Health insurers have member-level claims and spending account data, which can be leveraged to proactively contact members at the appropriate time. For example, a diabetes diagnosis might prompt a phone call from a disease management clinician, with advice on living with and treating diabetes. Used correctly, life event triggers can lead to better care at a lower cost for the member and, ultimately, lower costs for insurers.</p> <p>An organization that can successfully engage consumers with a life event-based member experience will hold the key to providing better overall customer care, as well as reducing the costs associated with maintaining a more reactive customer service approach.</p> <p>In short, you no longer have the luxury of waiting for customers to reach out to you.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/dont-wait-for-your-customers-to-call-you/">Don’t Wait for your Customers to Call You</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>This week marked the most significant implementation of the Affordable Care Act – the opening of federal and state exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health care insurance. Approximately 50 million Americans are currently without health insurance and since Tuesday, have demonstrated significant interest in what these exchanges have to offer.</p> <p>If the first day of the exchanges seemed mired in glitches, it may have been due in part to an unexpected influx of visitors to these sites. Initial numbers from federal officials counted 2.8 million visitors to <a title="Health Insurance Marketplace" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="_blank">healthcare.gov</a> as of late afternoon Tuesday. State-based exchanges also saw high traffic; with over 2 million people navigating to New York’s exchange within the first few hours, and California reporting approximately 5 million views before 3:00 PST.</p> <p>Some of these numbers may have been inaccurate, as was the case in California, where the initial number was later revised to 645,000. Even as the final data remains to be calculated and verified, there seems to be significant interest in the health insurance marketplace among the presently uninsured and individual buyers. For example, in the same time period that the federal exchange website received 2.8 million visitors, they also received 81,000 calls. Hawaii’s state exchange site, Hawaii Health Connector, indicated that it has received over 1200 applications to date.</p> <p>Ultimately, the numbers that matter the most are the number of people who enroll. So far, the federal government isn’t releasing information on how many people have signed up for health insurance via the new exchange. Not to mention that this week is only the first few days of a months-long purchase period.</p> <p>Nearly 65% of the more than 50 million uninsured Americans have indicated an interest in purchasing health care insurance by December 15 – the cutoff date to enroll in the new policies taking effect on January 1, 2014. However, HHS officials expect only 7 million people to sign up for individual coverage within the next year.</p> <p>Will the state and federal exchanges continue to draw huge numbers of visitors? Can the infrastructure of the exchanges sustain such high traffic? Will we see the number of new enrollees far exceed projections? We’ll report back periodically as we learn more.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/first-look-open-enrollment-outpaces-expectations/">First Look: Open Enrollment Outpaces Expectations</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Does your organization have multiple systems or platforms providing overlapping collaboration capabilities? Do users know which systems to use, and when? Do these systems have untapped resources that could provide additional benefit if properly implemented?</p> <p>As part of our ongoing look at the makings of an <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap</a>, we’re exploring the ways an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy can improve adoption and boost ROI by aligning the use of tools, platforms, and applications.</p> <p><b>ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION CAPABILITIES</b><br /> Enterprise Collaboration goes beyond document management and social tools, encompassing all of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Document Management</li> <li>Collaboration</li> <li>Intranets and Extranets</li> <li>Social Business</li> <li>Mobile Access</li> <li>Workflow and Process Automation</li> <li>Personalization</li> <li>Unified Communications</li> <li>Forms Management</li> <li>Search</li> <li>Business Intelligence</li> <li>Records Management</li> <li>Web Content Management</li> </ul> <p>With such a large set of capabilities, it is easy to understand why many companies are not using their Enterprise Collaboration platform to its fullest potential. Often, organizations are not aware of the potential uses, or lack proper governance to determine which capabilities should be applied and when.</p> <p>When creating an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy, we look at how a company is using their current platform(s) – evaluating how available tools can be used in new ways, and which capabilities should be discontinued. What existing assets could provide more benefits to users? How can we increase adoption? Make processes more efficient? Increase ROI?</p> <p><b>DOES ANYONE HAVE JUST ONE ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION PLATFORM?</b><br /> Enterprise Collaboration solutions are incorporated into the enterprise systems that users interact with daily. For example, Salesforce has document management and social tools; SharePoint is well known for document management, as well as social and workflow (among others); Jive offers many of the same capabilities; and project management tools often have some capacity for document management and workflow. With multiple systems providing overlapping capabilities, users become confused and ask questions like:</p> <ul> <li>Where should I store documents to share them with my team?</li> <li>Where do I find documents about product development, sales or other areas?</li> <li>Where do I post micro-blogs and see what others are posting?</li> <li>Which workflow tool should be used to automate this process?</li> <li>How do I best collaborate and share documents with external parties?</li> <li>Where do I place documents that I want to work on from home?</li> <li>Do records go into SharePoint like my other documents?</li> </ul> <p>Essentially, what users are asking is, “what system should I use for which purpose?” Further, IT and legal are left to ask how content is managed and controlled in each system. To evaluate this, we often use a tool called the Platform Usage Matrix, which documents the primary uses of each platform, as well as the primary platform for each enterprise collaboration capability.</p> <p>What are some key areas to consider as you look at your Enterprise Collaboration environment? A good Enterprise Collaboration Strategy looks at the tools used across the organization, evaluates how they can best be used (or not), and makes a plan for communicating these best practices to users – ensuring that you are making the most of each platform.</p> <p><i>Read more from our series on  <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap</a>s, including building the right <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: the Right Technology Foundation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-the-right-technology-foundation/" target="_blank">technology foundation</a>, <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: Content and Search are Key" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-content-and-search-are-key/" target="_blank">content and search</a>, and <a title="SharePoint Governance, Training &amp; Communication for Better Enterprise Collaboration" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-governance-training-communication-for-better-enterprise-collaboration/" target="_blank">governance, training and communication</a>.</i></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-how-to-simplify-your-platform/">Enterprise Collaboration: How to Simplify and Maximize Your Platform</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>With state and federal exchanges opening for business under the Affordable Care Act, tomorrow marks the first time millions of Americans will have the ability to shop, compare plans, and identify if they are eligible for a Premium Credit. Many eligible individuals have heard they can now “shop the exchange” but may still be asking, what does this mean to me?</p> <p>What do those who plan to shop the health insurance marketplace need to know?</p> <p><b>When can I enroll?</b><br /> The Open Enrollment period for exchange plans begins October 1, 2013 and will end on March 31, 2014.</p> <p><b>What are the penalties if I don’t enroll in health insurance?</b><br /> The ACA requires all Americans to have insurance coverage by January 1, 2014, or risk incurring penalties of 1% of yearly income or $95 per person per year, whichever is higher. In 2016, this fee is set to increase to 2.5% of income or $695 person, whichever is higher. For uninsured children, parents will incur a penalty of $47.50 per child. It’s also important to note that any individual not covered by a health insurance plan is responsible for 100% of any medical bills they incur.</p> <p><b>Am I eligible for a tax credit?</b><br /> By shopping the exchange, consumers can find out if they are eligible for Medicaid or a Premium credit. Individuals with income below $45,960, and married couples earning less than $94,200 are eligible for tax credits.</p> <p><b>What types of plans are offered on the Exchange?</b><br /> There are four different types of plans available for purchase on the exchange: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. With a Bronze plan, insurers will pay 60% of medical costs; Silver is 70% covered; Gold is 80% covered; and Platinum plans cover 90% of medical costs. The Affordable Care Act sets minimum standards for what insurance plans must cover by defining essential health benefits. Exchange plans must comply with these requirements in order to be considered a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) and be sold on the Marketplace. Some essential health benefits include:</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Ambulatory Patient Services</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Emergency Room Services</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Hospitalization</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Laboratory Services</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Maternity and Newborn Care</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Pediatric Services and Chonic Disease Management</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Prescription Drugs</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Preventative and Wellness Services</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Chronic Disease Management</span></li> <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Rehabilitation and Habilitative Services and Devices</span></li> </ul> <p>Will you be shopping the exchange on October 1?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/shopping-the-health-insurance-exchange-what-does-it-mean-to-me/">Shopping the Health Insurance Exchange: What does it mean to me?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

s are stepping up their efforts in shaping and driving digital strategies</a>. These are 4 of the top 5 areas where executives expect their companies to realize benefits from digital business:</p> <ul> <li>Digital engagement of customers</li> <li>Digital innovation</li> <li>Digital engagement of employees, suppliers and partners</li> <li>Automation</li> </ul> <p><strong>What is digital?</strong><br /> Not to be confused with traditional information technology solutions that primarily automate discrete business transactions – from our perspective, digital solutions are best described by words like web, mobile and social. Digital solutions done well effectively engage key internal and external audiences, automate collaborative workflow, and put the value of enterprise information to work.</p> <p><strong>Where are the priorities?</strong><br /> It’s not surprising that customer engagement ranks as a top priority. More than half of respondents indicate that digital engagement of customers is a top ten priority, and expect big gains in this area.</p> <p>Asked about the next wave of business-process automation, the CXOs surveyed indicate that their companies are automating a wide range of functions to improve the overall quality of processes – and, we would add, speed of execution. Few say they have automated processes primarily to replace labor.</p> <p>When it comes to innovation, we have seen companies harness the power of their workforce’s ideas and insights through digital social collaboration solutions to generate very real bottom line results.</p> <p><strong>Who’s leading the charge?</strong><br /> Senior management sponsorship and organizational alignment are the biggest contributing factors cited for successful digital transformation. Across the C-suite, larger shares of respondents report that senior executives are now supporting and becoming involved in digital initiatives. Almost one third said that their CEO personally sponsors these initiatives, with CIOs and CMOs not far behind. Further, almost one third of respondents also report a chief digital officer (CDO) on their companies’ executive team – one more chief to follow.</p> <p><strong>What’s next? </strong><br /> High expectations and continued investment. Less than a third of executives believe their organization spends the right amount on digital, and many worry about underinvesting in these programs, indicating that companies have a long way to go in accomplishing their digital-business agendas. Further, about 50% say their company is up to one-quarter of the way toward realizing their end-state visions for digital programs.</p> <p>How do these findings compare to your organization? Unless your company is a digital trailblazer, expect to increase investment and prepare for an exciting journey.

<![CDATA[
<p>If you’re following the latest Obamacare news, you may have heard the buzz about Walgreens “dropping” employee health insurance. What’s the real story? Walgreens is not discontinuing employee coverage, but moving to a private health insurance exchange. The confusion surrounding these reports can be attributed to consumers (and some journalists) not understanding the difference between state and federally sponsored public exchanges, and private exchanges, such as those offered by Aon Hewitt, Buck Consultants, Mercer, and others.</p> <p>Private health insurance exchanges enable employers to provide a “defined contribution” amount, giving employees a retail-based shopping experience, as they select from a broader range of products to find the plan that best aligns with their needs. The private exchange provides more choices and greater flexibility than the set of two or three options that employers have traditionally offered. In addition, the marketplace may even include health, dental, vision, life, auto, or homeowner policies. These private exchanges are separate and unrelated to the state and federally run exchanges introduced by the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>Public exchanges are focused on individuals who have no employer-based option, or qualify for government subsidies. These tax credits are available to households with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level. Due to these subsidies, the public exchanges may also be a good option for temporary and lower-wage workers.</p> <p>Walgreens is not the only large corporation looking at the private exchange option. Sears, Darden Restaurants, IBM, and Time Warner have all announced they plan to move some or all of their employees to private exchanges for group health insurance. Recent surveys by Aon Hewitt and Mercer indicate that more than 1 in 4 employers are considering moving to a private exchange in the next 3-5 years.</p> <p>Unfortunately, employees are very ill-informed about private exchange options. According to an Accenture survey, 83% of consumers are entirely unfamiliar with the private exchange concept. However, once informed, 85% of those surveyed expressed a neutral to positive outlook. Survey respondents liked the choice, flexibility, personalized product selection, and retail shopping feel of the private exchanges, and were willing to share personal information in order to make the experience more personalized.</p> <p>We know that it is critical to educate all healthcare consumers about the real options available to them. The public’s shocked response to Walgreen’s move to “drop” employee health care, in contrast with the positive reaction of educated consumers once they understand the role of private exchanges, is yet another example of exactly how important.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/is-walgreens-dropping-employee-health-insurance/">Is Walgreens dropping employee health insurance?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>In just under two weeks, the October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2013, open enrollment date for 2014 coverage will arrive. Issuers across the country have been preparing, yet risks remain, including recently reported concerns with the stability of the integration between the Federally Facilitated Marketplace

(FFM) and participating carriers’ online sales channels. Whether you have chosen to leverage the CMS Direct Issue Enrollment API and/or the FFM Lead Generation model – or will be integrating with a state-specific health insurance marketplace – are you ready with a contingency plan should the launch go less smoothly than planned?</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ready-or-Not.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-962" alt="Ready or Not" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ready-or-Not.jpg" width="530" height="645" /></a></p> <p>In the event that your October 1<sup>st</sup> individual open enrollment preparation is not where you’d like it to be, there is still time to come out on top.  Most consumers will likely purchase over the coming months. Make sure your members and prospects understand they can count on you.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Leverage consumer queries to improve consumer education efforts over the remaining open enrollment months. </strong> As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen your consumer education strategy, track and publicly communicate responses to common consumer queries. Start now, and continue as open enrollment progresses.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Leverage producer queries to bolster the support available to your broker and agent community. </strong>As your producer community reaches out for support, engage them with training to maximize the effectiveness of your unique tools and strategies.  Make sure they understand the steps necessary to communicate with you to resolve their concerns and get answers to important consumer questions. Provide training updates based on common concerns.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Prepare for cut over for IT integration with your state’s exchange.</strong> Define and communicate contingency plans for every possible challenge.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Focus on stabilizing your payment redirect integration with your state marketplace(s).</strong></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Maintain your paper application, products, and rate approval as a priority. </strong> Your paper application process is the ultimate fall back, should you experience roadblocks with the launch of your online sales solutions. Verify that your paper submission process is clearly communicated and fully ready to support consumer and producer submissions.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Validate call center readiness.</strong> Staff your call center for an increase in call volume and make sure call center staff are comfortable with the steps for using your sales tools most effectively.  If your market includes a segment of speakers most comfortable communicating in a language other than English, make sure staff is available to meet their needs.</li> </ul> <p>Time spent planning for contingencies may be the edge needed to trump your competition in the coming months. Building consumer trust through transparency and clear communication to meet consumer needs may supersede “day one readiness” in the long run.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/open-enrollment-is-almost-here-are-you-ready/">Open Enrollment Is Almost Here – Are You Ready?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Few people question the value of Governance, Training, and Communication for SharePoint and Enterprise Collaboration programs. In fact, according to a recent Axceler survey, over 67% of respondents said SharePoint governance was very or extremely important. However, nearly half said governance was “not very” or “not at all” defined within their organization. Likewise, an AIIM survey found that 57% of large organizations report that SharePoint is not meeting their security/compliance requirements – a direct reflection on governance.</p> <p><strong>Is Governance a Dirty Word?</strong><br /> Governance is the first topic we discuss when starting an Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap, and the foundation of a good strategy. I often tell clients that a lack of governance won’t cause trouble at launch or even 6 months down the road. However at 12+ months, the lack of a solid governance plan will lead to problems that can suffocate your collaboration initiative.</p> <p>In some organizations, governance has a bad reputation, with numerous failed attempts at governance burned into employees’ minds. Your organization needs to get past this and develop the appropriate governance group and plan to effectively drive your collaboration environments.</p> <p>Some of the questions we ask about governance include:</p> <ul> <li>How does the organization feel about governance?</li> <li>Does your organization have a vision for SharePoint and your collaboration platforms?</li> <li>Is a Governance Plan in place? What does it cover?</li> <li>Who oversees and maintains the plan?</li> </ul> <p>Governance should never inhibit the growth of your collaboration environment. Rather, it should ensure that it can grow in a structured manner that continues to serve the organization.</p> <p><strong>Training &#8211; Will they figure it out?</strong><br /> Given that it impacts adoption, compliance, and security, we ask several questions about training. We need to understand if users are receiving the training necessary to use SharePoint and other collaboration platforms effectively and efficiently.</p> <ul> <li>What type of training is available to SharePoint users?</li> <li>Is there different training for different roles? What training is required for each role?</li> <li>How is training delivered? Is it available at the point of use?</li> <li>Do users feel like they know how to use the tool/platform?</li> </ul> <p>Training needs are different based on the role a user fills within the organization. Groups like General Users, Power Users, Developers, and Administrators each need appropriately tailored training plans.</p> <p>Each of these roles should be reviewed to see what level of training is required, based on the organization’s planned use of enterprise collaboration tools. And training isn’t a one-time activity – it is ongoing as new functionality and capabilities are introduced over time.</p> <p><strong>I Didn’t Know that was Available</strong><br /> Can a collaboration initiative be successful if no one knows about it? Unlikely. Yet, a communication plan is often a second thought. By helping users understand what changes are coming and why, you can avoid user stress and increase adoption rates. Some questions we like to pursue in this area include:</p> <ul> <li>Are there preconceived thoughts about SharePoint or other collaboration platform?</li> <li>What type of communication works best in the organization?</li> <li>Who are the key stakeholders?</li> <li>How do you communicate to all employees?</li> <li>Who should initiate the communication?</li> </ul> <p>Whether you consider training and communications part of governance or separate activities, they are critical factors in a successful Enterprise Collaboration program. Have you given these areas appropriate attention as you begin building your Enterprise Collaboration environment?</p> <p><em>Learn more about an <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap</a>, or take a closer look at <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: Content and Search are Key" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-content-and-search-are-key/" target="_blank">content and search</a> and establishing the <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: the Right Technology Foundation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-the-right-technology-foundation/" target="_blank">right enterprise collaboration technology foundation</a>.</em></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-governance-training-communication-for-better-enterprise-collaboration/">SharePoint Governance, Training &#038; Communication for Better Enterprise Collaboration</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been talking lately about <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap</a> efforts – what they are and why they are valuable – and how a good strategy can help you get the <a title="Enterprise Collaboration: the Right Technology Foundation" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-the-right-technology-foundation/" target="_blank">right enterprise collaboration technology foundation</a> in place. In this post, we’ll go into more depth on two of the areas covered in an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap: content and search. Content and search are virtually inseparable &#8211; content is essentially worthless if users can’t find it, and search has little value if there isn’t useful, tagged content.</p> <p><strong>Content is Everywhere</strong><br /> According to IDC, the compound annual growth rate of unstructured data in enterprises was 68% from 2008–2012, a number that will only grow. In addition, there are over 4 trillion paper documents in the US alone, with 880 billion added each year[i]. As these documents continue to be digitized, it only complicates the matter.</p> <p>From an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy perspective, we care not only about the amount of content, but also a wide range of content characteristics. The common “who, what, where, when, how” applies to enterprise content. A sampling of content questions includes:</p> <ul> <li>Who creates, consumes, and collaborates on content?</li> <li>What is it? Office docs? CAD files? PDFs? Videos? Social feeds?</li> <li>Where does it come from – internal, external? Where is it getting stored – SharePoint, network drives, thumb drives, cloud services?</li> <li>When is it expired, retained, stamped as a record, destroyed?</li> <li>How is content approved, published, secured, organized, tagged?</li> </ul> <p>Answers to these questions help identify the types of content in your enterprise, and create a foundation for effective future organization, taxonomy and management.</p> <p><strong>Where is that document? When did I see that Activity Feed post?</strong><br /> Within an enterprise, we commonly find multiple document management systems, network drives, individual computers, social tools, proprietary applications and other content storage areas inside, and outside, the company. With content scattered across the organization, finding information quickly and easily becomes critically important for collaboration to be effective.</p> <p><a href="http://www.aiim.org/what-is-enterprise-search">AIIM defines enterprise search</a> as “The practice of identifying and enabling specific content across the enterprise to index, search, and display to authorized users.” When looking at search from a collaboration strategy perspective, we need to understand specifics about the content used in collaboration, so we ask questions like:</p> <ul> <li>Where is content (such as unstructured content, social content, instant messaging content, etc.) stored?</li> <li>How is it searched today?</li> <li>What metadata is applied to content?</li> <li>Does your organization have an enterprise search strategy or implementation?</li> <li>Is content outside the organization (external collaboration platforms like Dropbox, Box, vendors SharePoint systems, Jive, Chatter) available to search?</li> </ul> <p>Storing and organizing content is inextricably linked with search and retrieval. An enterprise collaboration strategy lays the groundwork for robust, effective content and search.</p> <div> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /> <div> <p>[i] Coopers and Lybrand</p> </div> </div> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-content-and-search-are-key/">Enterprise Collaboration: Content and Search are Key</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>With the <a title="https://www.healthcare.gov/downloads/MarketplaceApp_Checklist_Generic.pdf" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/downloads/MarketplaceApp_Checklist_Generic.pdf" target="_blank">October 1<sup>st</sup></a> open enrollment date less than a month away, one enormous question remains: what do consumers know about the <a title="About the Law | HHS.gov/healthcare" href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/index.html" target="_blank">Patient Protection Affordable Care Act</a>, and are they aware of how the health care law impacts health insurance coverage?</p> <p>Recently, we conducted a study to help us understand what individual shoppers know about Health Care Reform. Participants included those likely to be impacted by <a title="https://www.healthcare.gov/" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="_blank">Health Care Reform</a> who also have some of the attributes below:</p> <ul> <li>Eligible to receive an <a title="https://www.healthcare.gov/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums/" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums/" target="_blank">Advanced Premium Tax Credit</a> towards the purchase of health insurance for 2014 – based on reported household income level</li> <li>50% mix of men and women</li> <li>Under age 65</li> <li>Have or previously had an individual or family health insurance policy</li> <li>Decision maker in obtaining a health insurance policy</li> </ul> <p>It was not surprising to learn that all participants had heard something about Health Care Reform, but perceptions varied widely as to how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would specifically impact them.</p> <ul> <li>A majority did not think their own health insurance would be impacted by the ACA, even though many would be eligible for a tax credit subsidy.</li> <li>Few were aware that the individual mandate takes effect on 1/1/2014.</li> <li>Several were under the impression that they could purchase a health insurance plan directly from the federal government.</li> <li>Only one person was aware that health insurance enrollment begins on October 1<sup>st</sup>.</li> </ul> <p>Participants were asked to define certain ACA related terms, including <a title="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace/" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace/" target="_blank">Exchange</a>, <a title="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace/" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a>, <a title="http://healthcoverageguide.org/reference-guide/coverage-types/public-or-subsidized-health-insurance/" href="http://healthcoverageguide.org/reference-guide/coverage-types/public-or-subsidized-health-insurance/" target="_blank">Subsidy</a>, and <a title="https://www.healthcare.gov/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums/" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums/" target="_blank">Tax Credit</a>. Some significant findings:</p> <ul> <li>Most did not know what Exchange means as it relates to health insurance.</li> <li>They correctly assumed that a Marketplace is where customers go to buy health insurance, and insurers go to sell it.</li> <li>No one could define a Subsidy, although one participant ventured “Maybe this is where the government can help me pay for health insurance.”</li> <li>A Tax Credit was interpreted as a credit you receive as part of your tax refund for having health insurance. Even considering this answer partially correct, no one in our study identified it as a tax credit to be used towards health insurance premiums.</li> </ul> <p>As open enrollment begins, how will consumers obtain accurate information about the ACA? An April 2013 <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-april-2013/">Kaiser poll</a> showed that nearly half of all Americans are unaware of the impact of the ACA on themselves or their families. The same survey also showed that 40% anticipated looking to family and friends for information about the health care law, versus just 11% polled who would seek ACA information from a health insurer.</p> <p>Many sources are popping up to inform consumers about the ACA, but this may not sufficiently address the root of the problem &#8211; a lack of basic understanding around health insurance. Excluding ACA related verbiage, participants in our focus group were most challenged by industry terminology such as: <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-payment/">Copayment</a>, <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-insurance/">Coinsurance</a>, <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/deductible/">Deductible</a>, <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-maximum-limit/">Out-of-Pocket Maximum</a>, and <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/preferred-provider-organization-PPO/">PPO</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/health-maintenance-organization-HMO/">HMO</a>. Although most were current policyholders &#8211; policies that they had purchased themselves &#8211; the fundamental concepts of health insurance were somewhat foreign.</p> <p>How did these consumers shop for health insurance without knowing much about it? It turns out that most chose, or planned to purchase, an insurance policy because of at least one of the reasons listed:</p> <ul> <li>“It’s what I had in my previous job.”</li> <li>“Whatever insurance my parents had when I was a kid is what I signed up for.”</li> <li>“I went with the largest insurance company.”</li> <li>“I got the cheapest insurance I could find.”</li> </ul> <p>Only a handful were able to explain how health insurance works, or reported spending time actively comparing benefits covered in addition to price. Unsurprisingly, these were the same individuals who were more knowledgeable about the ACA &#8211; but even among this more informed group, there were misconceptions about its impact on their own coverage.</p> <p>Most participants in our study were college educated and enrolled in a health insurance plan, but in spite of this, found the concept of health insurance complicated. They are certainly not alone &#8211; a study published in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629613000532" target="_blank">September 2013 issue of <em>Journal of Health Economics</em></a> looked at Americans’ understanding of health insurance and showed that only 14% of those studied were familiar with the terms deductible, copay, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket caps.</p> <p>We cannot expect consumers to effectively navigate the world of the ACA and health insurance exchanges when most shoppers do not understand the fundamentals. The goal for payers should be to educate prospective customers and policyholders on the basics of health insurance in a simple, engaging way. In doing so, insurers will have a more confident consumer, and can begin building the trusted relationship required to foster customer engagement.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/what-are-consumers-saying-about-health-care-reform-health-insurance/">What are Consumers saying about Health Care Reform &#038; Health Insurance?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>When we talk about the Affordable Care Act, trips to the doctor, or the latest in eHealth, are we talking about healthcare or health care? Reputable publications fall on both sides of the fence, but it appears that the industry is trending toward healthcare. According to <a title="Healthcare vs. health care" href="http://grammarist.com/spelling/healthcare/" target="_blank">Grammarist</a>, <em>healthcare</em> has gained precedence outside of North America; however, both the New York Times and HealthCare.gov adhere to the two word approach. Sometimes, <em>health care</em> appears as a noun (e.g., “Preventative health care is important.”), while <em>healthcare</em> is used as an adjective (e.g., “Find a healthcare professional near you.”)</p> <p>The hardline English majors among us will likely continue to refer to the ACA as <em>health care</em> reform<em> </em>– after all, you don&#8217;t combine child care into two words – but the trend toward a one-word <em>healthcare</em> shows no sign of slowing. As pragmatists will point out, we used to insist on web site as two words. Eventually common usage won over, with the AP Stylebook announcing the change via Twitter – a story you can read on <a title="AP Stylebook Finally Changes “Web site” to “website”" href="http://mashable.com/2010/04/16/ap-stylebook-website/" target="_blank">any number of websites</a>.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-care-or-healthcare/">Health Care or Healthcare?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>With more than 1 billion users logging on to interact with friends, family, and brands, many B2C companies look to Facebook to engage and acquire customers, leveraging strategies like crowdsourcing and gamification. Capital One and American Express frequently run advertisements promoting customer rewards, and American Express lets consumers link their credit card to a Facebook application providing special offers and discounts based on their “Likes” and interests. Although B2C companies often find success with Facebook, is Facebook a viable B2B platform where companies can engage with other businesses? Opinions vary among social media experts. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers to determine where Facebook ranks among social media outlets in terms of its relative value as a B2B platform.</p> <p>Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn top B2B social media rankings in traffic (i.e. number of site visits), visit-to-lead generation, and conversion rates. Facebook leads the big three in driving B2B traffic with a 54% share, followed by Twitter (32%) and LinkedIn (14%) [i]. Facebook has a huge lead when it comes to exposure and visibility, but how does it perform in generating leads from those visits?</p> <p>When a business spends time and money in order to attract visitors and gather valuable marketing information (such as contact information), it is known as lead generation. Only 9% of Facebook visits result in lead generation. LinkedIn may have smaller traffic numbers, but they also come in at 9%. The leader of the pack, with 82% of social media leads, is Twitter. Twitter outshines LinkedIn and Facebook 9-to-1, and shows much more promise in terms of B2B engagement [ii]. So while the number of generated leads is important, does it lead to new clients? This is the fundamental question businesses consider when investing time and money into utilizing social media as a B2B platform, which brings us to conversion rates….</p> <p>Conversion rates are defined differently by audience, industry, marketing channel, customer motivation, etc. In its simplest form, conversion occurs when a consumer or business purchases a product, service, data, or information.  Twitter has the highest conversion rate (2.17%) compared to LinkedIn (.80%) and Facebook (.74%) [ii]. Based on this data, if a company chooses to utilize a social media network as a B2B platform, Twitter may be their best option. Many organizations will also make use of other marketing channels such as organic search (1.45%), paid search (1.96%), email (2.89%), referrals (2.04%), or blogs [ii].</p> <p>Based on the data, Twitter is the clear social media leader for B2B marketing, which brings us back to our original question – is Facebook a viable B2B platform? Yes, it is. While the impact may be smaller, it is possible to successfully reach a business audience through Facebook. Invest time in crafting your marketing strategy, and determine the role that social media – including Facebook – will play in those plans.</p> <p><em>Sources:</em><br /> <em>[i] Optify Inc. &amp; Kuno Creative</em><br /> <em> [ii] Optify Inc.

<p>As SharePoint admins, we typically deal with end-users who have gone column crazy on their SharePoint list, causing the <em>&#8220;This view cannot be displayed because the number of lookup and workflow status columns it contains exceeds the threshold (8) enforced by the administrator&#8221;</em>

error. Beginning with SharePoint 2010, resource throttling was introduced at the web application level to limit the number of items a list view (database query) can process in a single request, as well as to limit the number of lookup columns a single view can utilize at one time.</p> <p>In this post, we will take a look at the <strong>List View Lookup Threshold</strong>:<br /> <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ListViewLookupThreshold1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1280" alt="ListViewLookupThreshold1" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ListViewLookupThreshold1.png" /></a><br /> <em>Central Admin &gt; Application Management &gt; Manage Web Applications &gt; General Settings &gt; Resource Throttling</em></p> <p>First, let&#8217;s look at what <a title="Designing large lists and maximizing list performance (SharePoint Server 2010)" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262813.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> has to say about this particular threshold:</p> <blockquote><p>Each lookup column in a list view causes a join with another table. Each additional lookup column in a view increases the complexity of metadata navigation and list view queries. In addition to standard lookup columns, single-value managed metadata, multiple-value managed metadata, single-value people and group columns, and multiple-value people and group columns count as lookup columns.</p></blockquote> <p>So why should we be concerned about the number of lookup columns in a list view? (A hint&#8230; PERFORMANCE)</p> <p>Adding lookup columns to a view does not cause a gradual or linear decrease in performance. The graph below shows the change in throughput as the number of lookup columns in a view increases. As you can see, the change in performance from zero to eight is rather stable, but at 10 lookup columns throughput greatly decreases. This test was performed with the list by using only one row. If a list is row wrapping, then performance degrades faster.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ListViewLookupThreshold2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1281" alt="ListViewLookupThreshold2" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ListViewLookupThreshold2.png" /></a></p> <p>The following column types count against SharePoint&#8217;s list view lookup threshold:</p> <ul> <li>Standard lookup columns</li> <li>Single-value managed metadata columns</li> <li>Multiple-value managed metadata columns</li> <li>Single-value people and group columns</li> <li>Multiple-value people and group columns</li> </ul> <p>To get a better look at this, we can modify the URL of the list in question to return the list schema in XML format:</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://<strong>{YOUR_SITE_URL}</strong>/_vti_bin/owssvr.dll?Cmd=Display&amp;List=<strong>{YOUR_LIST_GUID</strong>}&amp;XMLDATA=TRUE</span></p> <p><em>Quick tip</em>: To retrieve the GUID of a SharePoint list, navigate to the list settings page and copy the encoded GUID from the browser address bar. To quickly decode the GUID, <a title="URL Decoder/Encoder" href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/" target="_blank">visit this free tool.</a></p> <p>Looking at the sample list schema below, we can see that the columns mentioned above are designated as lookup columns:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ListViewLookupThreshold3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1282" alt="ListViewLookupThreshold3" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ListViewLookupThreshold3-1024x467.png" /></a></p> <p>One thing to note is that the &#8220;Created By&#8221; and &#8220;Modified By&#8221; columns, both of which are commonly included in list views, count as lookup columns. In addition to these columns, we have found that &#8220;Workflow Status&#8221; columns also count towards the list view lookup threshold.</p> <p>Therefore, the complete list of columns that count towards the threshold includes:</p> <ul> <li>Standard lookup columns</li> <li>Single-value managed metadata columns</li> <li>Multiple-value managed metadata columns</li> <li>Single-value people and group columns</li> <li>Multiple-value people and group columns</li> <li>OOTB Created By &amp; Modified By columns</li> <li>Workflow Status Columns</li> </ul> <p>Next time you find yourself troubleshooting a list view lookup threshold issue, start with the basics! Verify your threshold setting in Central Admin and understand which columns in your list view are counting towards the threshold.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-list-view-lookup-threshold/">SharePoint List View Lookup Threshold</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

s, talking through topics such as Governance, User Experience, Infrastructure, Tools, and beyond. Over the next several weeks, we will take a closer look at how we use client insights to develop a comprehensive roadmap. To keep things scoped, we’ll focus on Infrastructure, Tools, and Development in this post.</p> <p><strong>Infrastructure</strong><br /> Although we take a comprehensive look across current technologies, SharePoint is quickly becoming ubiquitous as an enterprise collaboration platform. As a result, we often view it as the cornerstone solution for collaboration. Our main focus when building a roadmap for Infrastructure is to ensure that the right hardware and software on which SharePoint will run is deployed and configured according to industry best practices.</p> <p>Many of the clients we work with already use SharePoint. Our interviews and analysis tools will dive into:</p> <ul> <li>What version of SharePoint are you running? What CUs/SPs have been installed?</li> <li>What are the topology, resource allocation, and service distribution of your farm(s)?</li> <li>How many users access the environment? Is everyone internal, external, or both?</li> </ul> <p>Following the interview, we will go over in detail the impact (both positive and negative) of your current infrastructure, and the steps required to set you up for success. The roadmap may guide you through changes ranging from CU installations to the creation of a SharePoint infrastructure to host your farm.</p> <p><strong>Tooling</strong><br /> There are many tools available to help you manage governance, security/permissions, site provisioning, stale content and users, page design, workflow, etc. in SharePoint. We have experience with <a title="AvePoint" href="http://www.avepoint.com/" target="_blank">AvePoint</a>, <a title="Metalogix" href="http://www.metalogix.com/" target="_blank">Metalogix</a>, <a title="Acceleratio" href="http://acceleratio.net/" target="_blank">Acceleratio</a>, <a title="Nintex" href="http://www.nintex.com/en-US/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Nintex</a>, <a title="SharePoint Designer" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/hh850380.aspx" target="_blank">SharePoint Designer</a>, and more.</p> <ul> <li>What tools are currently deployed to manage SharePoint? Who can use them, and what can they do?</li> <li>How are you analyzing and enforcing compliance?</li> <li>What steps do you take to migrate content?</li> </ul> <p>The roadmap will help clearly define the goals of the organization, and we’ll work with you to implement the right tools to help you achieve those goals. There’s also timing and budget to be considered – the roadmap artifacts, and the conversations along the way, are intended to help you define both.</p> <p><strong>Development</strong><br /> How does your team develop applications for SharePoint? With Content Editor Web Parts, InfoPath, SharePoint Designer, Visual Studio, or all of the above?</p> <p>Are you using SharePoint 2013 yet? If you have already upgraded, we’ll look into <a title="SharePoint 2013 Apps: Six Reasons You Should Care" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-apps-six-reasons-you-should-care/" target="_blank">SharePoint Hosted Apps</a> built using <a title="SharePoint Online – Developing and Publishing a SharePoint Hosted App" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-online-developing-and-publishing-a-sharepoint-hosted-app/" target="_blank">Napa Tools</a>. Of course, there are Auto-Hosted Apps deployed to Azure, and maybe your PHP developers are creating Provider-Hosted apps too.</p> <p>Working in tandem, we will discover the types of applications and the range of developers you have in your organization. We will uncover your enterprise SDLC and how it’s being applied in the SharePoint ecosystem (or often not being applied). Defining a roadmap that helps your developers collaborate is a big win for the enterprise. The roadmap will help you align your development team and get them collaborating to create best-of-breed solutions. The solutions they build will further enhance the collaboration experience across your entire organization.</p> <p>We’ve helped clients of all sizes define their own roadmap for enterprise collaboration, working together to improve usability, performance, and compliance. In the end, we deliver not only a roadmap but a path to improved adoption and greater return on investment for SharePoint and other technologies in the enterprise.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-the-right-technology-foundation/">Enterprise Collaboration: the Right Technology Foundation</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In 1999, Bill Gates published “Business @ the Speed of Thought: Succeeding in the Digital Economy”; fast forward fourteen years and Tahoe Partners is preparing to present at the upcoming <a title="Global Directions 2013" href="http://www.globaldirections2013.com/" target="_blank">Global Directions 2013 Conference</a>, titled “Fast Data for Fast Business: Intelligent Information Management Across the Enterprise”. I couldn’t help but reflect on Mr Gates’ book, Tahoe’s core service offerings and the key messages of our conference presentation.</p> <p>The premise of Gates’ book is that information flow is the lifeblood of a company, and a ‘digital nervous system’ is required to facilitate this information flow in order to produce a highly effective organization. Today, the technologies are available to optimize the digital nervous system and reap the potential benefits of big data, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Providing timely insights into vast amounts of customer-centric data (customer intimacy)</li> <li>Rapidly enabling innovation directly impacting products and services (product leadership)</li> <li>Further optimizing business models and operational processes – (operational excellence)</li> </ul> <p><a title="Global Directions 2013" href="http://www.globaldirections2013.com/" target="_blank">Global Directions 2013</a> will focus on the fact that while big is good (especially since the technology is now capable of handling all this data) it&#8217;s only half of the story. From a business perspective, it&#8217;s much more important that data be &#8220;fast&#8221;, rather than &#8220;big&#8221;. That&#8217;s where the rubber meets the road.</p> <p>Tahoe Partners will expand on the ‘fast data for fast business’ discussion, exploring the critical requirements of Usability and Adoption. Organizations have the ability to get the right information, target the right users, and deliver it in a timely (fast) manner, but still struggle to effectively increase end-user adoption. If information isn’t delivered in a simple, usable interface, efficiency is lost, the speed of business critical decisions slows, and opportunities are missed. Research by <a title="The rise of the networked enterprise: Web 2.0 finds its payday" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_rise_of_the_networked_enterprise_web_20_finds_its_payday" target="_blank">McKinsey</a> and Gartner has shown that collaborative solutions, when adopted, produce a more productive environment:</p> <ul> <li>77% increased speed to knowledge</li> <li>28% increase in successful projects</li> <li>29% reduced time to market</li> <li>52% increased speed to internal experts</li> <li>41% increase in employee satisfaction</li> </ul> <p>People adopt technology that they enjoy!</p> <p>In the digital age, businesses differentiate themselves through information flow, the ability to engage end-users, and to change the way people collaborate. Information work is the norm and <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Deskless Workers and BYOD?" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-deskless-workers-and-byod/" target="_blank">deskless workers</a> are commonplace. Have companies recognized and accepted the fact that ‘systems of engagement’ are different than ‘systems of record’?  Do they understand that engagement is driven by adoption? That today’s information worker expects that workplace technologies match the power and simplicity of consumer tools?</p> <p>In order to truly leverage the power of big data, transform it into fast data, and reap the benefits associated with customer intimacy, product leadership and operational excellence, collaborative solutions must drive usability, adoption and engagement. Elements such as aesthetics, interaction, usability, personalization and mobile help to drive a rich user experience, one that maximizes current technologies and puts a wealth of information at users’ fingertips.</p> <p>Mr. Gates’ predictions about the digital nervous system have come to fruition – the <a title="Global Directions 2013" href="http://www.globaldirections2013.com/" target="_blank">Global Directions 2013</a> conference is just one of many proof points. What will our presentation add to the conversation? We’ll look at adoption through the lens of strategy, creative design, and technology enablement, and explore our belief that real engagement and collaboration are fostered by deploying solutions that people really want to use.</p> <p>We hope to see you this September in Washington, D.C.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/big-data-fast-data-usable-data/">Big Data!

s that must be navigated. Given that SharePoint is a popular enabler of enterprise collaboration, we thought it would be worthwhile to elaborate more specifically on the common SharePoint pain points we see across our clients.</p> <p>We see the 5 roadblocks below as the most common.</p> <p><strong>F
]]>
<![CDATA[
rustrated Users</strong><br /> If your site is difficult to use, it will quickly be abandoned. Inconsistent user interfaces, unintuitive navigation, and confusing site configurations minimize the productivity gains that come with enterprise collaboration. If your users are asking, “How does this help me better do my job?” <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Two Reasons for Poor Adoption" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-two-reasons-for-poor-adoption/" target="_blank">you may have hit this common stumbling block.</a></p> <p><strong>Missed Opportunities</strong><br /> SharePoint is powerful, but it is often deployed with only basic functionality (like simple team sites) and treated as a glorified file sharing system. Consequently, users may attempt to use SharePoint for purposes better handled with another tool, or acquire unnecessary applications to perform functions that SharePoint is well-suited for. <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Two Reasons for Poor Adoption" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-two-reasons-for-poor-adoption/" target="_blank">Be sure to take an enterprise perspective</a>.</p> <p><strong>Security and Access</strong><br /> Sensitive content is often exposed to unintended audiences due to poor design and implementation, raising issues of confidentiality and compliance. This risk is even greater when a SharePoint rollout includes a powerful search engine such as Microsoft&#8217;s FAST. Search should be speedy and efficient, but if <em>anyone</em> can find <em>anything</em>, <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Ungoverned Confusion" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-ungoverned-confusion/" target="_blank">it’s time to take a look at your governance plan</a>.</p> <p><strong>Departmental Silos</strong><br /> Don&#8217;t let SharePoint exist in a vacuum. When collaboration tools are focused exclusively on departmental needs, your users miss out on enterprise-wide benefits. If your Sales team loves SharePoint and the rest of your organization barely signs in, <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Breaking Down Organizational Silos" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-breaking-down-organizational-silos/" target="_blank">they might be working in a departmental silo</a>.</p> <p><strong>SharePoint Sprawl</strong><br /> Lack of governance can lead to SharePoint ghost towns abandoned by users, or total sprawl and unmanaged growth. Without oversight, you run the risk of losing content, functionality, and development in the wilds of an unregulated SharePoint environment. <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Ungoverned Confusion" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-ungoverned-confusion/" target="_blank">Control and consistency are key</a>.</p> <p>If one or more of these pain points sounds familiar, you should consider an <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap</a>.

2014 individual coverage approaches, are you educating your customers – earning trust and positioning yourself to become an insurer of choice?</p> <p>Most consumers are open to learning about new 2014 coverage options. Creating a smooth education experience – providing the information consumers need in formats they can readily use – may be what distinguishes one insurer from the next. With our clients, we have seen a focus on exploratory learning experiences through a health reform education website, in-store kiosks, and an online tutorial around shopping on and outside of state exchanges. We have also seen community outreach through educational seminars and moderated social media interaction.</p> <p>But are creative formats the only success factor in effective consumer education? Quality content can be just as important. Here’s a list of key content considerations. Do your consumer education materials:</p> <ol> <li>Address top consumer concerns?</li> <li>Share factual and accurate information?</li> <li>Provide consistent messaging?</li> <li>Maximize accessibility?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Are you reaching consumers with a message describing new options for coverage and for increasing coverage affordability?</strong><br /> Foremost among reported consumer concerns is affordability for coverage which adequately covers needs. There are indications that nearly 70% of consumers are unaware of new options for coverage in 2014, including benefits which improve affordability and add value. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Subsidies for premium reduction and cost-sharing assistance</li> <li>Essential health benefits, inclusive of emergency room care, maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, preventative and wellness services, and mental health disorder services</li> <li>The provision that insurers cannot refuse coverage for or increase cost due to pre-existing health conditions</li> </ul> <p><strong>Do your education materials report credible facts regarding the Affordable Care Act</strong> – a<strong>nd are your materials fresh and interesting? </strong><br /> One way to keep material fresh is to spotlight specific ACA provisions or benefits through a variety of channels – blog articles, social media announcements, email and text messaging campaigns, and/or web or newsletter features.</p> <p><strong>Are you ensuring consumers are aware of the requirements for consistency and the subsequent benefits they can expect to receive? </strong><br /> Consistency is regulated under the Affordable Care Act – through Summary of Benefits &amp; Coverage and access to a uniform glossary of terms commonly used in health insurance. Leveraging<strong> </strong>these mandates as a promoted benefit to your consumers can bolster your position as customer-focused and a source of transparent information.</p> <p><strong>Have you made your educational materials accessible to consumers based on their needs? </strong><br /> Some insurers are opting to provide materials in Spanish as well as English, and in a manner appropriate for the expected reading and education levels of the target population of uninsured. We have also seen a focus on ensuring mobile device compatibility for online tools, to support an anticipated need to reach low-income, uninsured consumers who may have access to a smart phone – with limited access to full web content.</p> <p>Education can be a cure for confusion and an excellent opportunity to secure the attention and trust of consumers. By reaching out to your current and future clients and educating them on new options for 2014, you can establish yourself as an insurer who is ready to be there for your consumers – before they ever need to rely on your services.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurers-are-you-educating-your-customers-on-new-coverage-options-for-2014/">Health Insurers: Are You Educating Your Customers on New Coverage Options for 2014?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>With reform deadlines looming and guidelines changing almost daily, it’s difficult to set aside time for innovation and out of the box thinking. However, stepping out of our routines and letting the creative juices flow can be refreshing and bring new insights to daily activities.</p> <p>As a Health Care Strategy team, we recently took some of our own advice and conducted an internal innovation session. The purpose was simple and straightforward – to take a fresh look at how health insurance companies currently engage customers, asking <em>if we were to build portals from scratch, unfettered, what would it look like?</em></p> <p>We called in the full breadth of talent – from visual designers, to user experience specialists, to content experts, to digital strategists (although we did ask the technology gurus to sit this one out). Splitting into groups, each team was tasked with developing an idea from whiteboard to wireframe and presenting their concept to the full group. The final proposals were fascinating. But the teambuilding and the innovation process might have been even more valuable.</p> <p>Whether it’s due to location or workload, an innovation session is ideal for teams that don’t have the opportunity to interact on a daily basis. Throwing out ideas (no matter how seemingly far-fetched) and discussing them with peers in an open, collaborative environment not only builds camaraderie among employees, but has an energizing effect that they can take back to the workplace.</p> <p>Does your organization offer opportunities to break from the day to day and think creatively? Tell us about it – <a title="Tahoe Partners" href="https://twitter.com/tahoepartners" target="_blank">we’d love to hear what you are doing</a>.</p> <p>How did we know that our innovation session was a success? When we broke for the evening, we kept hearing, “when can we do this again?”</p> <p>Interested in joining our next workshop, or talking innovation?

<p>“We have a great enterprise collaboration tool. Why aren’t employees using it?” Sound familiar? You&#8217;re not alone &#8211; we’ve heard this from many clients. They&#8217;ve established outstanding websites, tools, and functionality, often at significant cost, but they aren’t being used. Why?</p> <p>In previous blog posts, we’ve covered the reasons this occurs, including <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Two Reasons for Poor Adoption" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-two-reasons-for-poor-adoption/" target="_blank">lack of enterprise strategy and integration to work activities</a>, <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Ungoverned Confusion" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-ungoverned-confusion/" target="_blank">lack of governance</a>, and <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Breaking Down Organizational Silos" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-breaking-down-organizational-silos/" target="_blank">organizational silos</a>. In addition, a common situation we encounter is a lack of internal communication and marketing surrounding enterprise collaboration initiatives.</p> <p><strong>BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME</strong><br /> “If you build it, he will come” worked out well for Kevin Costner in the movie Field of Dreams, but building an enterprise collaboration tool is not enough to ensure its adoption and ongoing use. You have to market the capabilities and benefits to your employees through consistent, timely, and relevant communication. You need to introduce them to new ways to collaborate, show them what&#8217;s in it for them, model and incent use of the capabilities, and in some cases even tell them they must use certain pieces.</p> <p><strong>COMMUNICATION PLAN</strong><br /> One of the best ways to ensure consistent communication about your collaboration initiatives is by creating and following an Enterprise Collaboration communication plan. However, <a title="Discover SharePoint" href="http://www.discoversharepoint.com/" target="_blank">according to recent Microsoft User Experience Research</a>, a majority of people were introduced to SharePoint without any communication plan to drive adoption. Involving Corporate Communications (or the team responsible for internal communications) is critical.</p> <p>A communication plan is always important, and it is essential if your organization&#8217;s previous collaboration efforts have failed, stalled or experienced poor adoption.</p> <p>We’ve worked with clients on communication plans ranging from pretty standard to completely unique. While the exact plan will vary based on your organization, some common approaches include:</p> <ul> <li>Messages from executive sponsors and senior leadership</li> <li>Posters and/or tri-folds in cafeteria or break areas</li> <li>Mentions in company newsletters</li> <li>Digital signage</li> <li>Lunch and learn sessions</li> <li>Collaboration evangelists</li> <li>Inclusion in performance plans</li> <li>Ongoing involvement in enterprise collaboration initiatives</li> <li>Sharing of success stories</li> <li>Giveaways, like water bottles and coffee cups</li> </ul> <p><strong>INVOLVEMENT</strong><br /> One area mentioned above that deserves extra attention is the involvement of employees in collaboration initiatives. Surveys, requirements sessions, informal feedback, user testing, training, and other techniques allow you to build a solution that better meets the needs of the user, and to share the solution with the most influential users. People who are involved make better advocates and increase the amount of grassroots communication.</p> <p>Since most of us are focused on building great collaboration environments rather than baseball diamonds, make sure you have a <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">strategy and roadmap</a> that will foster adoption and growth through communication and marketing.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-build-it-and-they-will-come/">Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Build It and they Will Come</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>I recently read a blog that defined deskless workers as those who “spend more time on their feet and less time on their butts.” And even less time, we can assume, in front of a computer. Are these deskless workers obstacles to effective enterprise collaboration? We often hear that the challenges of bridging technology, access, and BYOD mean that deskless workers cannot fully engage with an enterprise collaboration platform. We disagree.</p> <p>The first type of deskless worker, task-centric users, are those who are not issued a PC (or any device with a web browser) by their employer. This group might include warehouse staff, field service, drivers, shop floor workers, and sometimes sales representatives. The second type, multi-device users, are typically issued a PC, but frequently leverage technology like smart phones and tablets in addition to their laptop. This group can include executives with busy travel schedules, various forms of knowledge workers, and sometimes sales staff.</p> <p>Task-centric users have relatively specific needs and typically don’t need every last bell and whistle. Multi-device users may have a wider variety of needs, but also a wider range of devices by which to fulfill them. This lays the foundation for the design challenge.</p> <p>With a good BYOD policy, the issue is no longer that your workers have no way to access your collaboration environment. The challenge becomes one of tailoring the solution to their needs and device options. You don’t want to do all of the same things on a phone as on a PC, at least not in the same way.</p> <p><strong>The basics</strong><br /> According to Cisco, deskless workers (at least, the multi-device user) typically need to do the following from their non-PC devices:</p> <ul> <li>Communicate in real time throughout the day</li> <li>Easily access experts and tools that allow interactive collaboration</li> <li>Access inventory information, company directories, and more</li> <li>Enter data into forms and participate in workflows</li> <li>Access email, calendaring, and personnel functions around benefits, policy, and procedures</li> <li>Access training information</li> <li>Participate in communities and virtual workspace where teams can interact</li> </ul> <p>The needs of task-centric users are much more specific and often more basic.</p> <p><strong>Point and click is moving to tap and swipe</strong><br /> The days of hyperlinked text and menu bars are fading fast and being replaced with more touch screen friendly design metaphors. This means you have to design a single enterprise collaboration platform with a responsive user experience tailored to different devices – phone vs. tablet vs. PC – while keeping the experience across devices as consistent as possible.</p> <p><strong>Responsive design – pick the right flavor</strong><br /> Responsive design can mean anything from automated (but often unsophisticated) reformatting of the user experience based on shrinking screen size to a highly tailored, consistent experience across devices.</p> <p>The wrong thing to do is attempt to deliver the same exact solution across all three devices. Your PC users might be satisfied, but your tablet and smart phone users will be underwhelmed at best, leading to low adoption. As access through these devices grows in popularity, that leaves an increasing chasm.</p> <p>In our experience, the answer lies in understanding the different types of users and roles in your organization, their specific needs and the devices they access to fulfill those needs. That plus a good design can deliver a multi-device solution that’s highly adopted and doesn’t try to do too much on an inappropriate device.</p> <p><strong>Governance and security</strong><br /> The smaller and more personal a device is, the more likely it is to be lost or fall into the wrong hands. Do you hear stories about professionals accidently leaving their laptop behind in a bar? Not so much, but phones? You bet. It’s important to build the right governance and security model. BYOD can further complicate this. What should a user be able to store locally on a device? Can you remotely wipe clean a lost or stolen device? What password protections should be in place across devices? These are all questions that can be addressed with the proper design to prevent the phone’s new “owner” from downloading your entire company directory or sneaking a peek at your latest product designs.</p> <p><strong>Are deskless workers and BYOD really obstacles to effective collaboration? </strong><br /> No. In fact, we think that deskless workers now have their best opportunity to be connected. Smart phones are ubiquitous, smashing through socio-economic and demographic barriers. Tablets are outselling PCs. These trends are not driven by enterprises, but by consumers. Your field technician probably has an iPad. Your warehouse worker probably has a smart phone. With proper design, BYOD becomes an enabler for connecting deskless workers to your enterprise collaboration platform. It all begins with a smart design and <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">roadmap</a>.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-deskless-workers-and-byod/">Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Deskless Workers and BYOD?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In business and in marketing, there are few words more overused than ‘innovation’ – but it has real impact on a company’s ability to remain competitive. Last week we talked about <a title="Health Insurance and Innovation: Trendsetters Emerge to Fill the Gaps" href="http://blog.tahoepartne
]]>
<![CDATA[
rs.com/index.php/health-insurance-and-innovation-trendsetters-emerge-to-fill-the-gaps/" target="_blank">the innovation gap for health insurers</a>, and how smaller players are leveraging technology to develop new consumer tools. This week, we are taking a look at how insurers can develop their own innovation programs.</p> <p>In the health insurance market, there is a red-hot battle over the evolving digital consumer interface and online enrollment in particular. With an additional 30 million Americans expected to go online this year in search of health insurance, insurers will largely win or lose based on their ability to differentiate themselves within the marketplace. But beyond the key milestones ahead, like any successful product company, health insurers will need to create a culture and methodology for sustained innovation.</p> <p>As a Creative Director, I help companies reinvent digital experiences and products. Often that means helping brands establish methods for continuous improvement and innovation. Here are some starters for creating your own innovation program:</p> <p><strong>Culture Is Critical to Invention</strong><br /> Innovation takes courage. As an organization, it means investing in unknown ROI, embracing change, and accepting occasional failure. Individually, it means putting your credibility on the line. Proposing ideas, accepting new ways of thinking, and supporting risk can be difficult. Creating a culture that embodies these qualities doesn’t happen overnight. Like many grassroots movements, it starts with a small, committed group. Build your core team and adopt a digital lifestyle. Momentum begins with conversation – consume, share, and socialize.</p> <p><strong>Innovation is a Design Process</strong><br /> You’ve formed a multidisciplinary team that brings together varying perspectives and subject-matter expertise. Nice job! Now, what’s your methodology? There is a simple notion at the heart of innovation – translating ideas into something tangible. That means visualization and prototyping. Your process needs to include various prototype formats that cultivate ideas from doodle to user-acceptance testing. The trick is doing it quickly, efficiently and effectively. Visualization is fundamental to invention but it is not a natural talent for most. Few of us learn storyboarding and storytelling in school. Invest in tools, training, and even specialized staff to facilitate and help improve these skills over time.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Inventive Environments</strong><br /> Part of sparking new ideas is breaking the routine and formal structure of our daily work life. You can foster innovation by creating workspaces dedicated to the process of invention. The goal is to break away from the rigid environment of offices, cubicles and conference rooms by creating a space more reminiscent of a laboratory, newsroom, and art studio. Open, modular, environments inspire team members to connect, share, and build. Immersive spaces where walls are papered-over in stimuli and team members meet around café tables set a tone for ‘what-if’ conversations.</p> <p><strong>Scope and Define Innovation</strong><br /> In the broadest sense, innovation is an holistic approach that considers all the critical aspects of a business – business model, operational process, systems, technology, consumer experience, and beyond. Defining the scope and specific areas of engagement is an important starting point for each project.</p> <p>Similarly, it’s essential to define your concept value statement, key benefits, and reasons to believe. Approach every concept from the consumer’s perspective: How does the product work? How do I get started? What do I do next? These details are critical to the function and acceptance of your ideas. Focus on crafting key messages, copy points and calls-to-action, and consider adding a part-time copywriter to your team.</p> <p>There’s always room for improvement, even in how we innovate. We’re continuously on the lookout for new techniques and methods. Dive in and keep experimenting.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/create-an-innovation-program-to-stand-out-in-the-health-insurance-market/">Create an Innovation Program to Stand Out in the Health Insurance Market</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

ore) for you to deploy as appropriate. We&#8217;ll follow the steps below:</p> <ol> <li>Create an App Catalog</li> <li>Create a Developer Site Collection</li> <li>Install the “Napa” Office 365 Development Tools (Napa Tools)</li> <li>Develop an App using the Napa Tools</li> <li>Add your App to the App Catalog and then to a site</li> </ol> <p>These instructions assume that you have sites on which you want to activate your app, and that you have the necessary permissions to perform the activities outlined in this post. Let’s get started!</p> <p><strong>CREATE AN APP CATALOG</strong><br /> The first step in this process is creating an Application Catalog for your organization.</p> <p>From the SharePoint admin center, navigate to the “apps” tab and click “App Catalog”. The value “Create a new app catalog site” will be selected by default, leave it as such, and press the “OK” button. Fill out all of the requested information in the “Create App Catalog Site Collection” form and press the “OK” button.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CreateAppCatalog.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1238" alt="Create App Catalog" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CreateAppCatalog.png" /></a></p> <p>At this point, you will be returned to the “Site Collections” tab in the SharePoint admin center, and your application catalog will begin provisioning. This catalog will host all of the applications that you choose to make available to your organization.</p> <p><strong>CREATE A DEVELOPER SITE COLLECTION</strong><br /> The next step in the process is to create a developer site collection. The collection&#8217;s root web will be where you develop and test your applications before publishing them; in that vein, it will be the site to which you add the Napa Tools.</p> <p>From the SharePoint admin center “site collections” tab – click New &gt; Private Site Collection. Fill out all of the required fields in the new site collection form – make sure you choose “Developer Site” from the Template Selection UI.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CreateDeveloperSite.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1239" alt="Create Developer Site" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CreateDeveloperSite.png" /></a></p> <p>At this point:</p> <ul> <li>You have an application catalog to host apps</li> <li>You have a site collection in which developers will create applications</li> </ul> <p>The next step is to install the Napa Tools into your environment.</p> <p>INSTALL THE NAPA TOOLS<br /> From the SharePoint admin center, go to apps &gt; Purchase Apps. Although it’s greyed out, select “&#8217;Napa&#8217; Office 365 Development Tools”. When the purchase screen comes up, press “ADD IT”, and you will receive a confirmation screen that the addition was successful. Click the “Return to site button”.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/AddingNapa.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1240" alt="Adding Napa" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/AddingNapa.png" /></a></p> <p>Now, navigate to the Developer site you created earlier, go to “Site Contents”, choose “add an app”, and select the Napa Tools app. From the modal trust dialog that appears, click“Trust It”. You will be returned to site contents, and in a short time, the Napa Tools will be added. You can now build SharePoint hosted apps (and a few other app types) using the Napa Tools.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TrustingNapa-1024x464.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1241" alt="Trusting Napa" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TrustingNapa-1024x464.png" /></a></p> <p>With the Napa Tools now installed, you can now move on to developing your App.</p> <p>DEVELOP AN APP USING THE NAPA TOOLS<br /> From within Site Contents, or from the Developer site home page, choose “Napa” Office 365 Development Tools. This will launch the application UI &#8211; select App for SharePoint, name your application, and click “Create”.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SpecifyAppType.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1242" alt="Specify App Type" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SpecifyAppType.png" /></a></p> <p>You’ll now enter the browser based IDE – “Napa”.</p> <p>There is a lot to explain about the App&#8217;s default pages, scripts, etc., and Microsoft does a great job of that here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/fp123577.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/fp123577.aspx</a>. We won’t get into all of the details &#8211; just note that App.js has a few default methods, and one of those methods will replace the text of the “message” div with a “Hello” message when the page DOM is ready. We won&#8217;t make any changes to the code for this exercise; instead, we&#8217;ll work with the default source code to walk through the test and deployment process.</p> <p>Let’s go ahead and publish our app for testing in the development site. On the side task pane of the IDE, click the Publish button. That will bring up the Publish settings window. Leave all of the defaults. Note the message at the top of the window reading, “The package will be published to the App Packages library”.  Click “Publish”. When the &#8220;Publish successful&#8221; text renders, click the “Visit the publish location” link. That’s going to take you to the App Packages library in the development site.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PublishToDev.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1243" alt="Publish To Dev" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PublishToDev.png" /></a></p> <p>Next, let’s test the application. Return to the home page of your developer site. Assuming you left all of the defaults, you will find the “Apps in Testing” web part on the home page. Click “new app to deploy, and add your new application.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DeployToDev.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1244" alt="Deploy To Dev" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DeployToDev.png" /></a></p> <p>From the “Apps in Testing” web part, click the link to your app. You will be redirected to your app web, and near the upper left hand corner, you’ll find the App.js logic has executed and written the message “Hello [current user]”.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TestingApp.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1245" alt="Testing App" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TestingApp.png" /></a></p> <p>Everything is functioning as expected! Let’s publish the app and make it available on a non-developer site.</p> <p>ADD YOUR APP TO THE APP CATALOG AND THEN A SITE<br /> If you were to navigate to a team site in your tenancy and click “add an app”, your new application would not be available. You must first add it to your App Catalog.</p> <p>From your Developer site, download an instance of your app. I do this by clicking the title link in the App Packages library of the developer site, and then &#8220;Save&#8221; via the Save UI surfaced by my browser.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SavingApp.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1246" alt="Saving App" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SavingApp.png" /></a></p> <p>Now that you have a local copy of your app, navigate to the App Catalog site you created in the very first step of this exercise. Click “Apps for SharePoint”, “+ new app”, and then upload the app using the “Add a document” form.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UploadingApp.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1247" alt="Uploading App" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UploadingApp.png" /></a></p> <p>Press &#8220;OK&#8221; in the &#8220;Add a document form, and then provide any metadata that is important for your organization using the “Apps for SharePoint” data form that subsequently appears. Save the form, and that’s it…your application is now available to sites.</p> <p>Navigate to a site on which you want to activate this application, click to “Site Contents” followed by “add an app”. Then, filter down to your applications “From Your Organization”. There’s your app – add it to the site by clicking on it, choosing “Trust it”.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TrustingApp.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1248" alt="Trusting App" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/TrustingApp.png" /></a></p> <p>You’ll be redirected to the Site Contents window, and after waiting a moment, the application will be available to on your site.</p> <p>That&#8217;s all there is to it. In a few steps, you have created a site that your developers can use to build SharePoint Apps and a means to publish those apps to your organization.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-online-developing-and-publishing-a-sharepoint-hosted-app/">SharePoint Online – Developing and Publishing a SharePoint Hosted App</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve covered what’s new and exciting in SharePoint 2013 in this space before, including posts highlighting <a title="Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Social Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-social-features/">social</a>, <a title="Top Enterprise Content Management Features in SharePoint 2013" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-enterprise-content-management-features-in-sharepoint-2013/" target="_blank">content management</a>, <a title="SharePoint 2013 in the Cloud" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">cloud</a>, <a title="Go Mobile with SharePoint 2013 – the Top 5 Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/go-mobile-with-sharepoint-2013-the-top-5-features/" target="_blank">mobile</a>, <a title="Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Search Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-search-features/" target="_blank">search</a> and more. Powerful new features are great, but features alone are not enough. Given that upgrading isn’t painless, the question is: how much benefit will SharePoint 2013 deliver based on the ways you currently use (or could use) SharePoint?</p> <p><strong>THE BENEFITS OF SHAREPOINT 2013</strong><br /> We have developed a free online tool that allows you to perform a quick but insightful <a title="SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment" href="http://www.tahoepartners.com/pages/assessment.aspx" target="_blank">self-assessment</a> to help evaluate the benefits of an upgrade to SharePoint 2013. Rather than investing lots of time researching the details of SharePoint 2013 on your own, or relying on guidance from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party that may be more interested in the software than your business, the self-assessment offers a high-level view tailored to your organization. Not all enhancements in SharePoint 2013 are created equal. Some capabilities have made huge advances while others are more incremental &#8211; evaluating these features against your business priorities is critical.</p> <p><strong>WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU?</strong><br /> In the self-assessment, we ask you to rate the importance of ten different SharePoint functions, including:</p> <ul> <li>Business Intelligence</li> <li>Collaboration</li> <li>Document Management</li> <li>Intranet</li> <li>Mobile</li> <li>Search</li> <li>Social</li> </ul> <p>Keep in mind that it’s not simply about the needs SharePoint fulfills today, but emerging business requirements such as social and mobile. SharePoint 2013 is truly an enterprise collaboration platform, and can do so much more than team sites and simple document management.</p> <p><strong>ARE YOU ALREADY USING AN OLDER VERSION OF SHAREPOINT?</strong><br /> The older the version you are currently running, the more you stand to gain from an upgrade to SharePoint 2013. Every version has made significant strides from its predecessors, so jumping more than one version has considerable advantages.</p> <p>If you’re currently relying on other tools to enable some of these needs, how many are you using? How current is the technology? How much does it cost you to maintain and enhance them? Our experience suggests that many companies are spending more than they should to support a fragmented collaboration environment that does not fully support their enterprise needs. SharePoint provides the opportunity to consolidate on a single platform that is a current and future market leader. In most cases, it’s also quite cost effective when compared to the alternatives.</p> <p><strong>GIVE IT A TRY</strong><br /> Give the <a title="SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment" href="http://www.tahoepartners.com/pages/assessment.aspx" target="_blank">SharePoint 2013 Assessment tool</a> a try &#8211; it is fast, free and informative. Of course, we’re always available to answer any questions and would be happy to help you interpret any detailed questions about your results.</p> <p><strong><a title="SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment" href="http://www.tahoepartners.com/pages/assessment.aspx" target="_blank">Take the SharePoint 2013 Self-Assessment now &gt;</a></strong></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-assessment-uncover-the-benefits/">SharePoint 2013 Assessment: Uncover the Benefits</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

s poised to change that. In addition to the previously uninsured individuals who will enter the health insurance market, a significant number of current group customers may switch to a direct market policy. Insurers will need to utilize cutting-edge technologies to compete with established peers and emerging players in the market, and most importantly, to capture an audience whose expectations are shaped by technology-embracing industries such as banking and auto insurance. The bottom line: direct consumers will expect more from health insurance.</p> <p>Will the health insurance industry rise to the challenge? Technology is changing at a pace that many insurers cannot maintain, at least not in the near term. Health insurance is still a heavy waterfall industry entering very agile times. That said, traditional insurers have demonstrated an increased focus on the Customer Experience, with investments in web-based education and targeted outreach to emerging consumer micro-segments, both cultural and generational.</p> <p>I predict that we’ll see (even more) small companies enter the industry and carve out niche service areas. They will develop cutting-edge products that bridge the gap between the data and information that insurance companies have in abundance, and the delivery methods that consumers demand. These innovators will engage consumers with transparent, convenient, interactive applications. I recently read about a new individual health insurance company concentrating solely on the young, tech savvy market. <a title="CakeHealth | The best free way to manage health care." href="https://cakehealth.com/" target="_blank">CakeHealth</a> bills itself as the <a title="Mint - Personal Finance, Budgeting, Money Management, Financial Management, Money Manager, Budget Planner, Free Budget Software, Online Banking" href="https://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a> of health care, and <a title="Find a Doctor – Doctor Reviews &amp; Ratings | Book Online Instantly – ZocDoc" href="http://www.zocdoc.com/" target="_blank">ZocDoc</a> lets users book a doctor appointment as easily as making a dinner reservation. Tools like these hit major touch points of consumer need – offering real-time information on-demand and free of charge.</p> <p>Health Care Reform has opened the doors for smaller players to enter the market and make an impact through innovative technologies. I am interested to see how the industry shifts as regulations take effect in October. I expect that large insurers will continue to do what they do best, providing policies to a majority of insured individuals; but also, that we will see many pioneering companies emerge with creative new tools to supplement the user experience.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurance-and-innovation-trendsetters-emerge-to-fill-the-gaps/">Health Insurance and Innovation: Trendsetters Emerge to Fill the Gaps</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Rate Shock – it’s on everyone’s mind, and under debate in every media channel. What is going to happen to individual consumers with the evolution of Reform? What are you, as an insurer, doing to make the transition seamless for your individual customers? If the transition to new plans is easy, more members will stay with their current insurer.</p> <p>Several options are on the table. Some insurers are re-establishing anniversary dates. This allows members to stay on their current policy for a longer period of time (through 2014), maintaining lower premiums and giving insurers more time to migrate members to new Qualified Health Plans. This option is highly dependent on individual State DOI approval. Even if approved, some states will require discontinuing current plans and replacing with an identical benefit plan with a new anniversary date. Other insurers are looking at migrating existing customers to an ACA compliance policy automatically (depending on state DOI approval) or through their shopping experience at the end of 2013. Any type of transition will require extensive member and broker communications through multiple channels.</p> <p>As you migrate existing users, you’ll want to consider what to use as the basis for migration or recommending a QHP. There are several options, including:</p> <ul> <li>Actual value and plan benefits</li> <li>Similar benefits to member’s current plan</li> <li>Similar cost to member’s current plan</li> <li>An additional low-cost option with the same network as the member’s current plan</li> </ul> <p>Within the migration plan, it will also be critical to identify those members who may now be tax-credit eligible, and to integrate this seamlessly into the member experience. Consider adding a tax credit estimator directly within the process, rather than forcing them through a separate experience.</p> <p>Make sure you are tackling the most pressing questions. How are you planning to migrate your existing customers? Do you know the regulations in your state? How will this be communicated to your members? Whatever the strategy, it is critical to define a seamless transition for the consumer through the online member portal as well as aligned communications through digital and direct channels. Helping consumers understand their options, the benefits of your approach, what any changes mean to them, and giving them the ability to seamlessly re-enroll will be keys to success.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurance-consumers-are-you-making-it-easy-for-them-to-stay-in-2014/">Health Insurance Consumers: Are You Making It Easy For Them To Stay in 2014?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Some organizations have taken an organic approach to enabling collaboration within the enterprise by making collaboration tools available – but often without considering best practices. At face value, putting departmental users in control seems like a reasonable way to facilitate adoption, howe

ver, this approach lacks good governance and leads to significant challenges in achieving long term enterprise adoption. When clients turn to us to help implement a governance strategy, it’s often because they are experiencing one or more common challenges related to weak governance: inconsistency across the organization, compliance issues due to lax security policies, or poor system performance.</p> <p>A <a title="Collaboration Tools Hampered by Governance Challenges" href="http://www.eweek.com/it-management/collaboration-tools-hampered-by-governance-challenges/" target="_blank">recent survey published in eWeek</a> found that 51% of respondents admitted their organization had not implemented any form of enterprise collaboration governance strategy. Of those with a governance plan in place, only a third said there was a general awareness of the governance plan or an ongoing management strategy. This shows a dramatic gap between the 67% of respondents who said governance was extremely or very important to their business.</p> <p><strong>Lack of consistency leads to confusion</strong><br /> Without effective governance, the only constant is that everyone will do things differently. Best practices are not applied, as users are left to their own devices. Training is nearly impossible because there are too many variations across users and departments. Enterprise content management and enterprise search become unachievable, as content is organized with a department focus rather than an enterprise focus. Collaboration implementations can quickly turn into a “wild west”, with hundreds or thousands of sites, many of them with outdated, unused content and no ownership. The worst possible outcome is a confused and frustrated user giving up. Governance doesn’t have to be hard, nor does it need to be confining. Doing some basic things consistently and according to best practices can pay huge dividends in downstream adoption and realization of enterprise benefits.</p> <p><strong>Confidential information made public</strong><br /> One of the first things an auditor will do is perform an internal search on the word “confidential”. The results can be surprising. Documents and content that are presumably secure are suddenly available to a much wider audience. The root of this issue lies in ineffective governance. Setting permissions and securing content are key elements of a strong governance plan. Once a problem of this nature is uncovered, the reaction is often to implement an overly restrictive policy, impeding users’ ability to find (non-confidential) information. Over time, an overly restrictive policy can lead to lower adoption as users perceive key information to be unavailable or too hard to access. Of course, the consequences associated with no policy or an overly liberal policy could be far worse. Effective governance strikes the right balance.</p> <p><strong>System performance is hobbled</strong><br /> Without governance on organizing and storing information, we’ve seen mistakes made that have brought performance of an enterprise collaboration system to its knees. Further, the manpower needed to support and maintain ungoverned and uncontrolled systems grows disproportionately to the size of the environment. If content and sites are properly deployed in concert with an overall governance plan, performance issues can be avoided. The last thing anyone wants is a slow performing system.</p> <p><strong>How can I avoid the problems that come with a lack of governance? </strong><br /> An enterprise collaboration roadmap provides the start of a governance plan. A good governance plan facilitates three key drivers of adoption: consistency, appropriate information access, and an architecture that delivers speedy system response times. Here’s a great <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">blog post that covers the Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap in more detail</a>.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-ungoverned-confusion/">Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Ungoverned Confusion</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>At this year’s AHIP Institute conference, there were two topics that seemed to overshadow all others: the customer experience and the Health Insurance Exchange. What these topics share is an emphasis on the individual customer and a shift away from B2B to a B2C focus. Health insurers understand that exchanges offer an opportunity to increase their customer base by capturing a portion of the newly insured. However, to attract those consumers, companies need to create an emotional bond with the customer.</p> <p>Speakers at AHIP provided some insight into how to build that bond. It’s essential to start from within – and that means creating the right culture and hiring the right people. Today’s B2C organization has to practice what it preaches, creating an open culture based on core values, with employees who represent those principles.</p> <p>In addition, insurers need to recognize what consumers go through &#8211; if we don’t understand our customers, how will we be able to connect with them? We hear buzzwords like “big data” all the time, and it’s true that current technology offers a treasure trove of information. But it’s essential to look beyond demographic data and really understand the consumer in order to provide an experience that is meaningful to them. It means walking in their shoes, understanding the highlights and the pain points-only then can we create an experience that they relate to.</p> <p>According to some of the statistics shown at AHIP, 70-80 percent of those currently uninsured do not know how what their options will be in 2014. Providing the right educational tools for consumers – not only about your products, but about health insurance in general – is part of creating a world-class customer experience. Many shoppers will be purchasing health for the first time. Engage these customers through communities and microsites, and empower them to self-service and easily provide feedback.</p> <p>To be successful in this new landscape of individual consumers, forward-thinking insurers realize they need to focus on key aspects that have made other B2C companies successful. The approach isn&#8217;t new, but it’s new to the insurance industry, and those who are able to become more customer-focused will see the greatest benefit.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurers-sound-more-like-marketers-and-thats-a-good-thing/">Health Insurers sound more like Marketers (and that’s a good thing)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>We’ve talked before about <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Two Reasons for Poor Adoption" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-two-reasons-for-poor-adoption/" target="_blank">low adoption as a killer of effective collaboration</a>, but organizational silos can be a huge obstacle as well. We have seen cases where collaboration tools are used with reasonable effectiveness within departments, but the broader enterprise benefits go unrealized. Why is this?</p> <p><strong>The problem with departmental adoption only. </strong><br /> Content and knowledge are generally not <em>only</em> useful and relevant to one specific department. It may not be valuable to everyone within an organization, but it’s rarely of importance to just one group. Further, many business processes have stakeholders or contributors across departments. Intentionally or not, limiting access to knowledge and content and transparency to enterprise business processes will reinforce departmental silos and impede collaboration at an enterprise level. What&#8217;s worse, departments often pick their own tools and platforms. If product development is using Yammer and your sales force is using Chatter, you can be assured that there’s not much electronic collaboration happening &#8211; not to mention the agony of watching your ongoing maintenance and support costs going through the roof.</p> <p>A recent McKinsey study, “<a title="The rise of the networked enterprise: Web 2.0 finds its payday" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_rise_of_the_networked_enterprise_web_20_finds_its_payday" target="_blank">The rise of the networked enterprise: Web 2.0 finds its payday</a>” concluded that “companies using the Web intensively gain greater market share and higher margins.” What executive wouldn’t get excited about that? Further, McKinsey states, “A new class of company is emerging &#8211; one that uses collaborative Web 2.0 technologies intensively to connect the internal efforts of employees and to extend the organization’s reach to customers, partners, and suppliers. We call this new kind of company the networked enterprise.”</p> <p>The networked enterprise requires an enterprise view of content, processes and use of collaboration tools.</p> <p><strong>Collaboration with the enterprise in mind.</strong><br /> <strong><em>Content</em></strong>. Two things that spring to the surface in a discussion of content are taxonomy and permissions. Once content is created and stored, the simple adage applies that information is only useful if it can be easily found. This is why search has become such a powerful tool. Free form text search has replaced almost every other historical method of retrieving electronic content. We have Google to thank for that. If you expect your internal customers to find information that will make them more productive at work in ways that are not clearly and accurately defined (taxonomy), it won’t be easy, and they’ll continue to use whatever less effective method they apply today. Of course, who can view and modify content is another important determination. Search can be powerful. Without the right restrictions, it could be too powerful.</p> <p><strong><em>Process/Workflow</em></strong>. Since many business processes transcend organizational boundaries, proper transparency across departments is critical. Many transactional processes centered on structured data have already been automated by ERP systems and the like, and provide transparency to those that need it. In our experience, what are often not automated are collaborative processes that involve unstructured content (documents, designs, etc.). Think of activities like product or project management &#8211; any process currently managed by spreadsheets and email. We’ve found huge opportunities to increase speed of execution to results and reduction in errors in these scenarios. In fact, one client was able to reduce turnaround time for transportation costing by 90%, and cut approval times in half. It’s amazing what’s possible.</p> <p><strong><em>Social.</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong> Although social business has its roots in consumer social technologies, this isn’t Facebook or Pinterest. Social business is about finding the right experts quickly, fostering communities of people with like interests and skills, improving project communication and execution, and about reducing the amount of email flowing through your organization. Some argue that social is the end of cc: in email. Time will tell, but without an enterprise solution and a common platform for collaboration, organizational silos prevail and the opportunity is squandered.</p> <p><strong>How can I avoid the trap of organizational silos? </strong><br /> In our experience, collaboration across the enterprise begins with a strongly supported enterprise collaboration strategy and roadmap. Buy-in and involvement across departments is essential. This strategy must set a foundation for content taxonomy built with users and their work activities in mind, along with appropriate permission safeguards. Surfacing opportunities to accelerate collaborative business processes is critical. <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">Here’s a great blog post</a> that discusses the Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap in more detail.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-breaking-down-organizational-silos/">Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Breaking Down Organizational Silos</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>The countdown to October 1 is on, and the next several months should tell us much about what health insurance will look like in a post-ACA world. With 30 million new consumers set to begin searching for health insurance, it&#8217;s time to rethink your digital strategy to make sure you are meeting the needs of this demographic.</p> <p>In a recent webinar, we took a closer look at what you should be watching, measuring, and tracking as this new population begins to purchase health insurance. We discussed why measurement is important, shared ideas on how to do it, and learned how the results could help you make real-time decisions in a rapidly changing insurance landscape.</p> <div class='embed-vimeo' style='text-align:center;'><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/68806090' width='400' height='300' frameborder='0'></iframe></div> <p>If you&#8217;d like information on future Tahoe Partners webinars on topics like Health Care Reform, customer engagement, and more, <a title="Tahoe Partners: SmartTalk Health Insurance Webinars" href="http://www.formstack.com/forms/?1506096-oga3Kk0LhG" target="_blank">click here to receive updates</a>.

<![CDATA[
<p>With the latest release of the technical specification document from the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) on June 18th, we seem to have come full circle to our exchange integration <a title="Health Insurance Exchange (HIX): Consider your FFE Integration Options" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurance-exchange-hix-consider-your-ffe-integration-options/" target="_blank">assumptions published on May 1<sup>st</sup></a>. In that post, we discussed an “Issuer Handoff to the FFE” model as an option for integrating your retail shopping experience with the Federally Facilitated Exchange. We then pointed out <a title="HIX Update: FFE Integration Options Reconsidered" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/hix-update-ffe-integration-options-reconsidered/" target="_blank">in a subsequent post</a> that CMS had yet to release any supporting documentation on this model, as they appeared to be solely focused on what we called the “Fully Integration Shopping Experience”. As of today, not only has CMS released specifications regarding the “Issuer Handoff to the FFE” model, but they’ve given it a name: the Lead Generation API. A month ago it seemed to be a safer play for issuers to switch gears and focus on the Direct Enrollment API, in the event that the Lead Generation API would not be available by October 1<sup>st</sup>. However, if the documentation released on Tuesday is any indication of the functionality CMS plans to have ready for Open Enrollment this fall, the Lead Generation API is back on the table.</p> <p>To review, under the <strong>Direct Enrollment</strong> model, users starting at the issuer website will be redirected the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to complete their eligibility determination. Upon completion, users would be redirected back to the issuer site to continue plan shopping and enrollment. This would prevent exposing the shopper to competitor products.</p> <p>The <strong>Lead Generation </strong>model is being offered as an alternative to the Direct Enrollment model for issuers that were not prepared to provide Direct Enrollment functions. When the consumer is redirected from the issuer website to the FFM, they will stay on the FFM after completing their eligibility determination to complete shopping and enrollment functions. When the user is redirected, the issuer can send a Plan Results Filter of up to 10 Qualified Healthcare Plan (QHP) IDs by which the FFM will filter plan results. With this filter, the user will only see the source issuer’s products upon initial view of plans. However, the consumer will have the ability to reset the filter if they wish to view all plans available on the FFM.</p> <p>So we have come full circle and are back to two integration models in which all of the opportunities and benefits we discussed in our original post still stand. Stay tuned for the latest issuer updates on Health Care Reform as we learn more about what to expect on October 1<sup>st</sup>.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FFE-Infographic.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1213" alt="FFE Infographic" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FFE-Infographic.png" /></a></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/cms-update-ffm-integration-options-reconsidered-again/">CMS Update: FFM Integration Options Reconsidered… Again!</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>A common theme I hear when speaking to clients is that, after meaningfully investing in intranets and collaboration tools, they are not effectively adopted. When we dig a little deeper, two typical causes emerge: lack of enterprise strategy, and lack of integration into work activities resulting in low perceived user benefit.</p> <p><strong>Build it and they will come.</strong><br /> A recent <a title="The Harsh Realities of Enterprise Social Collaboration" href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-collaboration/the-harsh-realities-of-enterprise-social-collaboration-020977.php" target="_blank">survey by Avanade published in CMS Wire</a> reported that approximately 70 – 90% business users utilize enterprise social networking tools, but feel that most lack true enterprise collaboration capabilities. Further, 82% want more enterprise collaboration capabilities in the future. Here’s the surprise. When asked what tools they primarily use for collaboration, Facebook ranks first at 74%, followed by Twitter, with SharePoint pulling in a distant third at 39%. That presents an interesting conundrum – a high percentage of enterprise users who leverage social technologies want more collaboration capabilities (which Facebook and Twitter do not provide) and somehow SharePoint (which does provide robust collaboration capabilities) ranks third. How can that be?</p> <p>From my perspective, one root cause is organizations deploying collaboration solutions piecemeal and departmentally, often without an enterprise vision. I’ve seen this lead to a skunkworks environment, where disjointed solutions lead to confusion and low adoption. A worst-case scenario occurs when an IT department tries to deliver enterprise collaboration on its own without a true business sponsor or enterprise strategy. We see this often with SharePoint – launched by IT as a glorified network drive to share documents, it never really progresses from there, despite the tool’s evolution as a true collaboration platform. <strong></strong></p> <p><strong>It isn’t helping internal customers get their work done. </strong><br /> Unfortunately, little consideration is given to the user or internal customer. Enterprise collaboration is supposed to improve workforce productivity, but if tools are deployed without taking into account users’ work activities and habits, and even further, integrated into them, enterprise collaboration is destined to fail. As one of my colleagues says, people engage with technology they enjoy. In the workplace, most of us seek to get more done faster – employees will not take the time to see how unfriendly, complicated technology can make them more productive. They’ll continue doing what they do today.</p> <p><strong>The Answer – a user centered roadmap. </strong><br /> In our experience, highly adopted Enterprise 2.0 starts with a user-centered roadmap for enterprise collaboration. Critically, this roadmap uncovers distinct user and usage groups, is built around high value opportunities to improve their work activities, and delivers an enterprise vision.  Without that, the best one can hope for is low adoption that evolves slowly and organically around confusing, piecemeal solutions. If this sounds familiar, <a title="Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/" target="_blank">here’s a great blog post discussing the Enterprise Collaboration Roadmap</a> in more detail.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-obstacles-two-reasons-for-poor-adoption/">Enterprise Collaboration Obstacles: Two Reasons for Poor Adoption</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

rror stories about collaboration implementations that turned into the Wild West, or went gangbusters out the door but quickly lost the attention and use of employees, partners, suppliers and vendors. An Enterprise Collaboration Strategy puts the foundation in place to help avoid these situations.</p> <p>For us, the purpose of an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy is to establish a baseline for the current collaboration environment, identify the desired future state of the environment, and document the appropriate initiatives to move towards that desired state.</p> <p><strong>WHAT WE LOOK AT IN AN ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION STRATEGY</strong><br /> Before you know where you’re going, you have to know where you are. We look across multiple dimensions in assessing the current state and identifying the desired future state, including:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Application Usage</strong>. How are current tools used for collaboration, and how could they be used?</li> <li><strong>Communication and Change Management</strong>. How can we best communicate collaboration opportunities to drive adoption &#8211; the cornerstone of success?</li> <li><strong>Content</strong>. What types of content are created, shared, and consumed?</li> <li><strong>Development, Maintenance and Support</strong>. How are collaborative solutions developed and supported?</li> <li><strong>Governance</strong>. What people, processes, and technologies are in place to manage the set-up and growth of the collaboration environment?</li> <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>. What infrastructure is needed to support collaboration goals?  Is the current infrastructure adequate for the desired growth?</li> <li><strong>Resources</strong>. What type of resources and skills are needed to build and support the collaboration environment?</li> <li><strong>Search</strong>. How do people find important content scattered across the organization?</li> <li><strong>Social</strong>. Can employees readily share what they are working on, and stay in tune with what others are doing?  Are subject matter experts easy to find?</li> <li><strong>Tools</strong>. What tools exist to automate the administration and governance of the collaboration environment? What is the appropriate timing for installing these tools?</li> <li><strong>Training</strong>. What do users need to know to leverage the capabilities of collaboration tools?</li> <li><strong>Usability and User Experience</strong>. How can adoption and usage be maximized by providing a user-centered experience?</li> </ul> <p><strong>HOW WE DO IT</strong><br /> First, we review current sites, tools, infrastructure, processes, and other documentation to get a solid understanding of the content, tools, and processes in use. Armed with this background, we perform individual and group interviews. While it is different for every organization, these generally cover a broad cross-section of the organization, including employees from all levels of the company. In these working sessions we hear what users are doing and what they want to do, and we share possibilities.</p> <p>In addition to internal interviews, we also leverage industry and practical best practices. These cover everything from governance, to team size and structure, to infrastructure and platform (such as SharePoint) knowledge.</p> <p><strong>WHAT WE DELIVER</strong><br /> By analyzing and assessing that information, we are able to deliver an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy, with details on:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Current state</strong>. Outlines findings on current uses of collaboration, as well as the main pain points and associated impacts.</li> <li><strong>Future state</strong>. Highlights future uses of collaboration technologies, and identifies tools and applications that may not be needed in the future due to platform consolidation.</li> <li><strong>Roadmap</strong>. Details specific activities to move from the current state to the future state. High level timeframes and budget estimates are completed for each activity and priorities are assigned.</li> </ul> <p>With an Enterprise Collaboration Strategy in place, an organization has a solid base to begin executing individual high-priority initiatives. These activities might focus on governance, increasing adoption through an intranet redesign, or creation/upgrade/stabilization of the infrastructure.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/enterprise-collaboration-strategy-and-roadmap/">Enterprise Collaboration Strategy and Roadmap</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>AHIP’s Institute 2013 is this week, and we&#8217;re gearing up to talk Consumerism, Federally Funded Exchanges, October 1, and beyond. Beyond the conference, we’re planning to attend the <strong>Consumer Experience Forum</strong> and are excited to hear what AHIP is saying about key issues, including:</p> <ul> <li>Developing innovative strategies to reach first-time consumers</li> <li>Frameworks and supporting tool sets to implement customer-focused strategies</li> <li>Data and informatics needed to support the customer-centric marketplace</li> <li>How to motivate consumers to change behavior and stay engaged</li> </ul> <p>We’ll also be at the <strong>Exchange Forum</strong> and want to learn more about AHIP’s perspective on the evolving marketplaces, and diverse perspectives on what’s happening at the state and federal level.  How are different organizations dealing with the uncertainty of the environment?  Can we expect more information on when final decisions and approaches will be defined at the federal level?</p> <p>Additionally, the entire track around <strong>The Nexus of Consumerism, Retail and Health Care:  Thriving in a Consumer-Centric Marketplace</strong> will be a focus for us. We are looking forward to comparing our own research on the newly insured with the findings John Fiacco, CEO and Co-founder, ConnectedHealth and Joan Kennedy, CP Consumer Health Engagement, Cigna HealthCare present during “<strong>The Health Consumer:  What do They Know?  What Do They Want? What Do They Need?</strong>”</p> <p>Finally, “<strong>Disruptive Innovation:  New Entrants and Ideas Driving Change</strong>” should provide valuable insight from the marketplace with speakers from Wal-Mart and Weight Watchers. We’ll be able to compare their visions with the research and behaviors we’ve seen from other non-traditional players.</p> <p>Institute 2013 should provide a great opportunity to network and share thoughts on these ever-evolving topics. <a title="Connect with Tahoe Partners at AHIP Institute 2013" href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=ue5dkreab&amp;oeidk=a07e7mdoioq4273fff3" target="_blank">Please let us know if you’ll be attending</a> – we’d love to compare notes!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/ahip-institute-2013-a-closer-look-at-consumerism-exchanges-and-october-1/">AHIP Institute 2013: A Closer Look at Consumerism, Exchanges, and October 1</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

But perhaps it is time to quit thinking about mobile and social separately and start thinking about them as part of a complete experience for the user.</p> <p><strong>MOBILE HAS TO BE PART OF A SOLUTION</strong><br /> Many of us have seen the staggering predictio

ns about the growth of mobile:</p> <ul> <li>In Q1 2013, smartphone shipments were higher than traditional cellphone shipments [i]</li> <li>Tablets are poised to out-ship PCs by the end of 2013 [ii]</li> <li>By 2018, 70% of mobile employees will conduct work on personal smart devices [iii]</li> </ul> <p>With the staggering predictions about increasing mobile use, a comprehensive solution cannot be created without addressing mobile usage and the mobile experience. Mobile should not be below the cut, optional, or even pushed to Phase II.  All solutions should include strong consideration for mobile because that is what users demand.</p> <p>Solution providers should not be proud when they support mobile – they should recognize they are seriously behind the times when their solution isn’t properly mobile enabled.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL HERE, SOCIAL THERE, SOCIAL EVERYWHERE </strong><br /> At the Gartner Summit, several of the sessions in the social track focused on how social functionality is now embedded in many applications. Just a few years ago, social capabilities were available only through a handful of specialized providers like <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive</a>, <a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a>, and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">NewsGator</a>. Now it seems that every platform in the enterprise claims some social functionality. CRM, ERP, Document Management, ECM, WCM, and other systems all contain social features. The question is, how does all this social capability impact the user experience? If a user has to go to three, four, or even five separate applications to use dedicated social functions, will the user become frustrated, and will adoption lag?  In most cases the answer is yes.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL INTEGRATION </strong><br /> Two ways to address the proliferation of social-enabled applications is to integrate and aggregate social information for the user.</p> <p>Integrating social information means that social functionality is integrated throughout the user experience. A user should not have to go to a specific location or application to be social – it should be woven into all areas. At Tahoe, we often have discussions with clients who are struggling with adoption of either their intranet or social collaboration environment (or both). The problem is often that there are multiple environments competing for users’ attention, with neither one providing the full experience the user desires. Intranets, social collaboration hubs, and business applications need to come together.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL AGGREGATION</strong><br /> Aggregating social information is the act of pulling social information from disparate applications into a single interface so it can be sorted, filtered, searched, and generally consumed in the way the user wants to consume it. If the user wants to see only information from one source, they can do that – but it is not forced by having separate interfaces for different sources of social content. NewsGator has moved in the direction of social aggregation in SharePoint with <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/products-and-solutions/capabilities/Empower-Smarter-Streams">Lookout</a>, and other providers are doing the same.</p> <p>Mobile and social are everywhere these days.  These aren’t trends that will go away &#8211; both are pervasive enough that we should quit thinking of them separately and instead think about them being core to all solutions. Are you thinking this way?</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /> <p>[i] International Data Corp.<br /> [ii] Gartner<br /> [iii] Gartner</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/social-and-mobile-must-be-part-of-all-digital-solutions/">Social and Mobile must be part of ALL Digital Solutions</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In <a title="Health Insurance Exchange (HIX): Consider your FFE Integration Options" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurance-exchange-hix-consider-your-ffe-integration-options/" target="_blank">a post earlier this month</a>, we examined two different workflow options to integrate the insurance retail shopping experience with the Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE). In a Fully Integrated Experience, users would be sent from the Issuer site to the FFE to conduct their eligibility determination. The user would then return to the issuer site to complete shopping and payment – never viewing competing issuers’ plans. We also examined a second scenario, an Issuer Handoff to the FFE which would initially limit the user’s view to display only that issuer’s plans, and allow the user to complete plan selection on the exchange.</p> <p>Those issuers who hedged their bets on the more costly full integration (and they seem to be in the minority), may have unknowingly saved themselves some exasperation in the sprint to October 1<sup>st</sup>. Based on the focus of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) on the Fully Integrated Experience, it seems increasingly unlikely that the FFE will be prepared to offer shop functions by the start of Open Enrollment this fall. This means that some type of Fully Integrated Experience is no longer an expensive “nice-to-have” function, but now an expensive “must-have” experience if insurers want to sell their On-Exchange Portfolio online.</p> <p>So what happens when a user goes to directly to the FFE? Stay tuned for more updates as CMS and the health insurance market tackle the technical challenges of Health Care Reform.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/hix-update-ffe-integration-options-reconsidered/">HIX Update: FFE Integration Options Reconsidered</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>It’s been a few weeks since the Gartner Portals, Content and Collaboration Summit, so I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on what I saw and heard.</p> <p>Two words… mobile analytics.</p> <p>At #GartnerPCC, you would have had to really try hard to not hear at least one presenter stress the importance of the mobile user experience – it would not be an exaggeration to say that the majority of presentations I attended had a strong mobile slant.</p> <p>While the importance of mobile is nothing new, the conference got my wheels turning fast on analytics. What is it that we’re trying to measure? And, does mobile let us measure more?</p> <p><strong>Mobile App Measurement is Different</strong><br /> A mobile app, by definition, causes some interesting challenges when it comes to measurement. Unlike the web, how do we measure behavior when connectivity isn’t required? Consider numerous phone types, operating systems, and cellular carrier networks, and you have yourself a whole new set of challenges. For this reason, many organizations have found themselves reliant on third-party vendors to provide insights on mobile app adoption and usage.</p> <p>But, let’s talk about what could be possible.</p> <p><strong>How’d They Do That?</strong><br /> If I stood on my head in front of my laptop keyboard, no one would be the wiser. But, turn my mobile device to landscape mode… and someone just may. Along with traditional web usage metrics, what does <em>how</em> the person performs the search now tell us? Was it something they enjoyed? Was it something they did quickly while walking down the sidewalk (safely of course)? As long as we’re willing to search, as UX practitioners we now have a richer set of data to analyze and build testable hypothesis. If someone is constantly switching the orientation of their phone, then maybe we did something wrong?</p> <p><strong>Location, Location, Location</strong><br /> I know, I know… the idea that someone knows where I was when I performed a search does have a little creepiness built in. But, the marketer inside me loves it! Billboards, retail stores, and advertisements at sporting event are all stimuli that drive consumer behavior. Tell me the time and your physical location, and I may be able to tell you what inspired your interaction with us.</p> <p>Mobile analytics isn’t just something else to measure. The data we can now gather gives us a new perspective on our consumers’ interactions and experiences. It’s now on us to listen.</p> <p>Like most conferences, the Gartner Portals, Content and Collaboration Summit was three days of PowerPoint slides and vendor trinkets &#8211; but it delivered as intended. It got me thinking – and rethinking – about mobile beyond the usual paradigm. We know that providing a great mobile experience is table stakes for attracting and retaining customers – but now I’m imagining the possibilities of information and insight they might offer us in return.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/mobile-analytics-to-optimize-the-customer-experience/">Mobile Analytics to Optimize the Customer Experience</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you want to build a SharePoint 2013 application to download Google Analytics data for your company web site. One potential implementation is a SharePoint 2013 timer job, and one of the first questions you will have to answer is how your application will be authenticated when making calls to Google Analytics API. Of course, you can create a dummy Google account and hardcode its password in your application, but there is a better way to do it: use the public-key-based OAuth with service accounts. In this post, we&#8217;ll provide example code to demonstrate the authentication component of the logic, and that will get you started on building your SharePoint 2013 timer job.</p> <p><a title="OAuth" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">OAuth</a> is a very powerful and flexible authentication specification, and therefore is very complex. Fortunately, Google provides a set of APIs to handle all of the boring details. To make it work, generate the API key in the Google API console and enable access to the Analytics API. In the Google API Console create a new Client ID, and make it a Service Account.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/googleapiconsole.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1180" alt="Google API Console" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/googleapiconsole.png" /></a></p> <p>The console will produce a private key file and make it available for you to download. Store the file somewhere safe, because it is the only copy of your private key.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/googlepki.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1182" alt="Google PKI" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/googlepki.png" /></a></p> <p>Note the email address of the service account generated together with the private key. You will need it later.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/googlefingerprint.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1183" alt="Google Fingerprint" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/googlefingerprint.png" /></a></p> <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: In the Admin console for your Google Analytics account, grant access to the service email address created above. If you miss this step, Google .Net API will return a “403 Forbidden” error later.</p> <p>To test the authentication, let’s create a simple console application.</p> <p>First, download the latest <a title="Google .NET API" href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-dotnet-client/wiki/APIs#Google_Analytics_API" target="_blank">Google .Net API</a>. With that done, create the console application in Visual Studio, and reference the following assemblies from the Google .Net API package:</p> <ul> <li>DotNetOpenAuth</li> <li>Google.Apis</li> <li>Google.Apis.Authentication.OAuth2</li> </ul> <p>Now, the best part. The following code creates an object which implements Google’s IAuthenticator interface. We will use this object to add authentication information to all subsequent requests to the Google Analytics API. Note the path to the public key file, the service email address, and the scope we are authenticating to. In this example, we are requesting read-only access to the Analytics data.</p> <pre>private const string SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL = 
 "xxxx@developer.gserviceaccount.com";
 private const string SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PKCS12_FILE_PATH = 
 @"abc-privatekey.p12";
 
 static IAuthenticator CreateAuthenticator()
 {
 X509Certificate2 certificate = 
 new X509Certificate2(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PKCS12_FILE_PATH, 
 "notasecret", X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable);
 
 var provider = 
 new AssertionFlowClient(
 GoogleAuthenticationServer.Description, certificate)
 {
 ServiceAccountId = SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL,
 Scope = 
 "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly"
 };
 return new OAuth2Authenticator(
 provider, AssertionFlowClient.GetState);
 }</pre> <p>The following code makes a request to Google Analytics to download some data. The request URL has to contain the API Key you have registered in the Google API console, a Google Analytics Profile ID, and data query parameters. Notice that no user accounts are needed, and how simple it is to use the authenticator to add the “Authorization: Bearer xxxxyyyy” header to the request.  All details of OAuth negotiation are completely done behind the scenes!</p> <pre>//create authenticator
 IAuthenticator auth = CreateAuthenticator();
 
 //create simple request
 string requestUrlTemplate =
 "https://www.googleapis.com/analytics/v2.4/data?key={0}&amp;ids=ga:{1}&amp;dimensions=ga:networkLocation&amp;metrics=ga:visits&amp;start-date=2013-04-09&amp;end-date=2013-05-09";
 
 //we have to specify the application ID AIxxxx
 //and profile ID in the request
 string requestUrl = String.Format(requestUrlTemplate, 
 applicationKey, profileID);
 
 //create http request
 HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(requestUrl);
 //apply authentication header
 auth.ApplyAuthenticationToRequest(req);
 //send the request and get the response
 HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse();
 
 //read the response XML
 string responseXml;
 using (Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())
 using (StreamReader reader = 
 new StreamReader(responseStream, Encoding.UTF8, true))
 {
 responseXml = reader.ReadToEnd();
 }
 XDocument doc = XDocument.Parse(responseXml);</pre> <p>That’s it for the authentication piece. You can now run your console application and verify that with just a few simple steps, you can authenticate against the Google Analytics API using OAuth. The next step would be to port this code into a SharePoint 2013 timer job and store the data in SharePoint 2013 according to your business requirements.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/authenticating-net-service-applications-against-the-google-analytics-api/">Authenticating .NET Service Applications against the Google Analytics API</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>At the recent Gartner Portals, Content and Collaboration Summit, I attended a roundtable discussion titled “Why an App Isn’t an Application”. A dozen participants from various companies and the public sector discussed their current state and future plans for apps and applications. These leaders are responsible for internal systems, as well as customer facing tools and functionality. The first question posed was one that we hear a lot at Tahoe – what is the difference between an App and an Application?</p> <p><strong>APP vs. APPLICATION IS NOT ABOUT THE DELIVERY MECHANISM</strong><br /> Because of our iPhones, iPads, iPods, Android devices and the iTunes and Google Play stores, we are used to downloading and using apps. Many of us think that Apps are synonymous with phones and tablets, while Applications live on a desktop or laptop. This is not necessarily the case. You can have Apps on a desktop or laptop, and Applications on a tablet or phone. In fact, a few weeks ago we posted a piece on <a title="SharePoint 2013 Apps: Six Reasons You Should Care" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-apps-six-reasons-you-should-care/" target="_blank">Apps in SharePoint 2013</a>, which allows Apps to run in the desktop or on a mobile device.</p> <p><strong>APPS PERFORM A SINGLE FUNCTION</strong><br /> So if Apps vs. Applications is not about mobile vs. desktop, then what is the difference? In the roundtable session, we landed on a consensus that an App is designed for a single purpose – one piece of functionality. An Application, on the other hand, may handle a wide variety of functions. The App focuses on doing the one piece of functionality very well and providing an outstanding user experience.</p> <p>By this definition, google.com is an App. The one function it performs is search, and it provides a highly usable interface for that function. And of course Google’s search app is delivered through desktops, laptops, phones, tablets, and most everything in between. Tools like Salesforce and many internal support programs are Applications, containing a larger number of capabilities packed into a single program.</p> <p><strong>HOW MANY APPS IS TOO MANY?</strong><br /> After distinguishing Apps from Applications, one of the more interesting topics covered was the idea of having multiple apps, with each doing one thing, instead of a single application that has multiple pieces of functionality. Which is better for the user? One example was a city website providing multiple services to the public, including pothole reporting, water bill payment, news updates, and much more.  Would an end user rather have one application for the city, or would they prefer multiple apps &#8211; one to report potholes, one to pay their water bill, etc.? How many apps for a single company is too many? Statistics show the average iPhone user having between 40 and 50 apps on their phone &#8211; will users want multiple apps from a single company? How will they know which of the organization’s apps provides the functionality they want? All good questions that will take time and user experience testing to figure out.</p> <p><strong>DOES IT MATTER IF IT IS AN APP OR AN APPLICATION?</strong><br /> In the end, maybe the question is not whether you should be building an App or an Application, but how you can combine the best of both into something your users love. After all, users don’t care if it is an App or an Application by definition – they just want to EASILY accomplish their task, whether reporting a pothole, playing a game, executing a web search, or paying their water bill.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/gartner-summit-the-difference-between-apps-and-applications/">Gartner Summit: The Difference between Apps and Applications</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

ation ID to be generated. With the Correlation ID in hand, I used the light-weight <a href="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/ULSViewer" target="_blank">ULS Viewer</a> to take a look at the actual errors.</p> <p>These entries in the log proved to be crucial in identifying the issue:</p> <pre><em>Unexpected: Unexpected query execution failure in navigation query….</em></pre> <pre><em>High: An unexpected error occurred while manipulating the navigational structure of this Web...</em></pre> <pre><em>Unexpected: Unexpected PortalSiteMapProvider was unable to fetch children for node at URL: /YourSite/YourSubSite….</em></pre> <p>As indicated in the logs, I knew there was a possible issue with the navigation control of a specific web in my publishing site. A quick search led me to this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/joerg_sinemus/archive/2013/02/12/february-2013-sharepoint-2010-hotfix.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN SharePoint blog</a> by Joerg Sinemus, describing a bug introduced by the SharePoint 2010 August 2012 CU. The bug erroneously causes duplicate entries in the dbo.NavNodes table of the SharePoint content database, eventually rendering the database unusable.</p> <p>Armed with that newfound information, I opened up SQL Management Studio and expanded the <em>Tables</em> directory of the content database containing the site identified in the ULS log. Right-clicking the <em>dbo.NavNodes</em> table and <em>selecting the Top 1000 Rows</em> confirmed the issue. Using the <em>Name </em>column of the query results, I was able to quickly identify the problematic publishing page causing the navigation control to fail, as there were several hundred rows with the same entry.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/NavNodes.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1171" alt="NavNodes" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/NavNodes.png" /></a></p> <p>With the URL of the affected site and the name of the problematic publishing page, I was able to use SharePoint Designer to open the site and delete the page – removing the duplicate entries from the table and restoring site performance. The page can then be restored from the Recycle Bin.</p> <p>Looking ahead to a long-term resolution, Microsoft Support has indicated that the SharePoint 2010 <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;2775353" target="_blank">April 2013 CU</a> contains the fix for the duplicate NavNodes issue.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/duplicate-entries-in-the-dbo-navnodes-table/">Duplicate Entries in the dbo.NavNodes Table</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>At Tahoe, we often hear from clients looking to expand their use of SharePoint from intranets, extranets, and document management, to include line of business applications with process automation. With more robust workflows being implemented in SharePoint, Microsoft has introduced major changes in the workflow capabilities of SharePoint 2013 to support this growing need. We’ll take a look at these changes from a business user point of view.  For those interested in a more technical perspective, there are numerous <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219638.aspx">technet </a>and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj163181.aspx">msdn articles</a> to quench your workflow thirst.</p> <p>With every upgrade of SharePoint comes the worry about whether the new release will provide backward compatibility. You can breathe a sigh of relief &#8211; SharePoint 2013 provides support for SharePoint 2010 Workflows, and SharePoint 2013 workflows will function as they do in SharePoint 2010 without any changes. In fact, you can continue to build SharePoint 2010 workflows through the new SharePoint Designer.</p> <p>With that out of the way, let’s look at some of the improvements that will make you want to build SharePoint 2013 workflows to accomplish your business objectives.</p> <p><strong>SUPPORT FOR LOOPING IN SHAREPOINT DESIGNER</strong><br /> A well-known limitation in previous versions of SharePoint Designer was the inability to create loops. This missing feature was often by itself enough to cause companies to look at workflow providers like <a href="http://www.nintex.com/en-US/Pages/default.aspx">Nintex</a>, <a href="http://agilepoint.com/">AgilePoint</a>, and <a href="http://www.k2.com/platform/integration/sharepoint">K2</a>, or write complicated workflows in Visual Studio. Now SharePoint Designer-based workflows can loop a specific number of times, or until a specific condition is satisfied. If you are the nesting type, you can even put loops inside of loops. All joking aside, this is a great addition that opens up the types of workflows that can be created with SharePoint Designer.</p> <p><strong>VISUAL DESIGNER</strong><br /> Until now, SharePoint Designer has always been a text based tool. With SharePoint 2013 comes the introduction of Visual Designer. As with the majority of features discussed here, the Visual Designer can only be used when creating SharePoint 2013 workflows. Additionally, you need Visio 2013 Professional to use this tool. The Visual Designer itself is generally what you would expect – drag and drop of shapes that you then configure as needed. Many users will find this visual approach much easier to use and understand than the traditional text-based view.</p> <p><strong>STAGES </strong><br /> Stages provide a way to group logical sections of a workflow to reduce complexity. A workflow can contain a single stage or multiple stages depending on its complexity. Each stage holds various actions and concludes with a gate which determines where the workflow should go next. If you have created and modified complex workflows in previous versions of SharePoint Designer, you’ll appreciate this feature.</p> <p><strong>CALLING WEB SERVICES</strong><br /> Increasingly, SharePoint solutions reach out to other enterprise systems to gather and display data that is important to the user. This data is typically accessed through web services, and SharePoint Designer has added new functionality to support this. A new action called “Call HTTP Web Service” is available in SharePoint Designer to allow web service calls. This is another feature that opens up the power of workflows without requiring a third party tool or custom code.</p> <p><strong>BETTER SCALABILITY</strong><br /> A workflow is no good if it doesn’t run because the environment can’t scale to handle increasing demands. The entire architecture for workflow processing has been reworked in SharePoint 2013. For example, SharePoint 2013 workflows are no longer hosted by SharePoint; instead, they are hosted by Windows Azure Workflow, which is installed separately from SharePoint 2013. Your SharePoint and Windows Azure Workflow environments work together to execute workflows triggered in SharePoint. The details get technical, but the important point is that workflow scalability is dramatically improved and you can be confident using SharePoint workflows at the enterprise level.</p> <p>While this doesn’t cover all the improvements to workflows in SharePoint 2013, it gives you a preview of what’s new, and how it can be used to support your business. These changes don’t necessarily eliminate the potential need for third party workflow tools and custom code, but you are now able to accomplish much more before turning to those options.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-workflows-the-top-5-improvements/">SharePoint 2013 Workflows: The Top 5 Improvements</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Recently, I was working on a bug to reorder fields in a list form. I was pretty certain that I had successfully accomplished this by redeploying the content type after changing the order of Field elements in the definition (via update-spsolution). That is, fields appear in list forms in the same order they are specified in the content type definition, and changes to the order will be reflected when the content type is redeployed.</p> <p>Apparently, I was imagining that content type field order changes can be pushed through the definition after the content type has been deployed. I have listed the solution below, but to save you time, here are some methods that don’t work:</p> <ul> <li>As mentioned, reordering the fields in the CT definition Elements.xml</li> <li>Deleting the lists and redeploying</li> <li>Using new GUIDs for the field definition</li> <li>Completely removing/reinstalling all features (and the WSP). This uninstalls the content types, but even that did not work.</li> </ul> <p>Fortunately, we can turn to the <a title="MSDN Forums" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/category/sharepoint" target="_blank">MSDN Forums</a>, and a great community of SharePoint Architects and Developers. When neither Bing nor Google returned a good result to my question, the forum suggestion engine returned <a title="Programmatically change field order within content type" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sharepointdevelopment/thread/ed934181-d639-41c8-80eb-1cc4e11d67fb" target="_blank">this little gem</a>.</p> <p>All the way at the bottom was exactly what I needed (and, yes, I up-voted the post!):</p> <pre>SPContentType ct = web.ContentTypes["myContentType"];</pre> <pre>ct.FieldLinks.Reorder(new string[] {"Column1",  "Column2",  "Column3",  "Column4"});</pre> <pre>ct.Update(true);</pre> <p>Leverage the FieldLinks.Reorder method in your feature’s OnActivated receiver, and voila!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/specifying-the-order-of-fields-in-sharepoint-list-forms/">Specifying the Order of Fields in SharePoint List Forms</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>As October draws closer, have you thought through your operational and marketing strategy for subsidy eligible users who come directly to your site? What channels and shopping experiences are you planning to leverage to sell your Qualified Health Plans (QHPs)? If you want to retain some control over users’ ability to view competitor products while shopping your on-exchange plans, the Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE) is presenting specifications for two levels of integration into your shopping experience. We have put together a review of the Risks and Benefits of each to help you decide which is right for your organization.</p> <p><strong>Fully Integrated Shopping Experience</strong></p> <p>In a fully integrated shopping experience, users arriving at your site can shop and enroll in your on-exchange plans without ever being exposed to competitor products. This is achieved through the Direct Enrollment Application Programming Interface exposed by the Federally Facilitated Exchange. Although a significant benefit, it comes with commensurate expense in development work and user experience efforts.</p> <p><strong>Pro</strong>:  Subsidy Eligible users who come directly to your site complete enrollment in a QHP without ever being exposed to competitor products.</p> <p><strong>Con</strong>: IRS regulations prohibit access to Federal Tax Information required for the Eligibility Determination &#8211; restricting the ability to seamlessly integrate the application and creating an inherently degraded user experience.</p> <p><strong>Con</strong>: The cost associated with developing and testing the secure transfers of the consumer to the FFE and back, and invoking the Web Services exposed by the FFE, is significant.</p> <p><strong>Issuer Handoff to FFE</strong></p> <p>A second option has been presented to increase traffic to the exchange, while still providing issuers incentive to redirect customers to a site that also hosts competitor products. In essence, this is a handoff of the subsidy-interested user from the issuer’s site to the exchange. Upon initial display of QHPs, only that issuer’s plans would be presented. This is achieved by passing an identifier in the redirect that tells the exchange which issuer site the user was redirected from, and filters products accordingly. However, users would still have the ability to access competitor plans.</p> <p><strong>Pro: </strong>Drastically reduced cost from the Fully Integrated Shopping Experience.</p> <p><strong>Con: </strong>Subsidy Eligible users who come directly to your site will have access to competitor products once redirected to the Exchange.</p> <p>So which is right for you? There are many considerations that factor into the cost-benefits analysis of this decision, and each insurer’s marketing strategy will largely determine the approach taken by their organization. In the coming weeks, we’ll be exploring this topic further with a series of posts on exchange integration. Stay tuned to learn more.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/health-insurance-exchange-hix-consider-your-ffe-integration-options/">Health Insurance Exchange (HIX): Consider your FFE Integration Options</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>As we wrote earlier in the week, Tahoe Partners is attending Gartner’s Portals, Content and Collaboration Summit in San Diego next week. I’ll be heading to sessions from all four tracks, but I intend to focus primarily on two: Social Collaboration and Governing &amp; Exploiting Content.</p> <p>Since I have written quite a bit about SharePoint 2013 (like <a title="Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Social Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-social-features/" target="_blank">social features</a>, <a title="Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Search Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-search-features/" target="_blank">search features</a>, <a title="Go Mobile with SharePoint 2013 – the Top 5 Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/go-mobile-with-sharepoint-2013-the-top-5-features/" target="_blank">mobile features</a>, <a title="SharePoint 2013 Web Content Management Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-web-content-management-features/" target="_blank">WCM features</a>, and <a title="Six Reasons You Should Care About SharePoint 2013 Apps" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/six-reasons-you-should-care-about-sharepoint-2013-apps/" target="_blank">SharePoint Apps</a>), I’m looking forward to hearing some outside opinions. One session, “SharePoint 2013 – Advancements and Impact on Portals, Content Management, and Collaboration” should provide some interesting insight into whether SharePoint 2013 has really made progress in these key areas.</p> <p>While I’ve also talked about <a title="SharePoint 2013 in the Cloud" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank">SharePoint in the Cloud</a>, I haven’t spent much time on the other components of Office 365, including Office Apps. The session “Cloud-Based Office Systems: Google vs. Microsoft” sounds like a prize fight. I doubt any punches will be thrown, but it will be a great way to see how these offerings stack up against each other to meet the needs of business.</p> <p>I’m also looking forward to stepping outside the Microsoft world to hear more about other collaboration and portal products, successes and strategies.  Some of the other sessions I’m attending are listed below.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/PCC11/webpages/SessionDetail.aspx?EventSessionId=870">Box, Inc.: The Power of the Cloud: Driving Business Insight and Innovation in the Post PC Era</a></li> <li><a href="http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/PCC11/webpages/SessionDetail.aspx?EventSessionId=807">Case Study: Your Next Intranet — Combining Portal &amp; Social Disciplines to Improve Business Processes</a></li> <li><a href="http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/PCC11/webpages/SessionDetail.aspx?EventSessionId=805">Workshop: Your Next Version of SharePoint — In the Cloud or Not? (For end-users only.)</a></li> <li><a href="http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/PCC11/webpages/SessionDetail.aspx?EventSessionId=877">Yammer: Enterprise Social &#8211; The New Cornerstone of Collaboration</a></li> <li><a href="http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/PCC11/webpages/SessionDetail.aspx?EventSessionId=874">Citrix : Solving the “Dropbox problem”</a></li> <li><a href="http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/PCC11/webpages/SessionDetail.aspx?EventSessionId=825">To the Point: Socially Enabled Business Applications — Finding, Following and Filtering What Matters</a></li> </ul> <p>If you’re attending the conference and want to catch up on any of these topics, or perhaps something more social, <a title="Connect with Tahoe at Gartner PCC" href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=ue5dkreab&amp;oeidk=a07e7cf8zqpb3bbc774" target="_blank">let me know</a>!</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/social-and-content-governance-at-gartner-portals-and-collaboration-summit/">Social and Content Governance at Gartner Portals and Collaboration Summit</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>I won’t deny that a miserable, cold Chicago Spring has me excited to head to San Diego for <a title="Gartner Portals, Content and Collaboration Summit" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/portals/" target="_blank">Gartner’s Portals, Content and Collaboration Summit</a>. But more than the weather, there are a few topics that I look forward to hearing more about.</p> <p>It is not surprising that many of the sessions offered on the User Experience track center around mobile. This has been of particular interest to me lately, as I recently interviewed call center reps from an insurance company, who told me that up to 40% of calls they take are now from people on mobile devices not at home or in front of a computer. For some reason, this number surprised me, and got me thinking about how much opportunity we have to build better mobile consumer experiences. I’m curious to see if others at <a title="#gartnerpcc" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gartnerpcc&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#GartnerPCC</a> share my thoughts around how voice and speech recognition need to be part of a truly elegant mobile experience – without sliding backwards into a world of frustrating IVR prompts and defiant virtual agents.</p> <p>In addition, I’m planning to participate in a workshop on how to review your own website. The concept is basic, but I’m eager to hear different approaches to a fundamental component of what we as UX practitioners do on a regular basis. As a consultant, it’s easy to critique someone else’s work. Give me an application or web portal and I’ll give you recommendations. This process becomes much harder when you are asked to critique something that you are intimately familiar with, something you have an emotional connection to, and something that you think is good.</p> <p>Finally, here are some other sessions I plan to join. If you will be in attendance, <a title="Connect with Tahoe Partners at #GartnerPCC" href="http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=ue5dkreab&amp;oeidk=a07e7cnq0q2bad95f05" target="_blank">please reach out</a>!</p> <ul> <li>The Five Graphs of the Modern Web</li> <li>Roundtable: Why an App Isn&#8217;t an Application</li> <li>Workshop: Build Development Communities to Build Better Software</li> <li>Panel: Designing Apps for the Work People Really Do by Using Information They Need</li> <li>How Disruptive Vendors Are Threatening Your Incumbent Vendors</li> </ul> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/user-experience-and-mobile-at-the-gartner-portals-and-collaboration-summit/">User Experience and Mobile at the Gartner Portals and Collaboration Summit</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p><a title="Hu-Friedy" href="http://www.hu-friedy.com/" target="_blank">Hu-Friedy</a> is a leading manufacturer of state-of-the-art dental equipment, with a long history of technological innovation. When they launched a new company-wide SharePoint intranet (HUGO), they saw an opportunity to maximize their investment by adding business intelligence report delivery through Microsoft BI.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hu-Friedy-Screenshot.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1139" alt="Hu-Friedy" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Hu-Friedy-Screenshot-1024x717.png" /></a></p> <p>They turned to Tahoe to create a solution that could deliver critical information across the organization quickly and in a user-friendly format. Our work at Hu-Friedy drastically increased the breadth and depth of their business intelligence reporting, and eliminated the investment of time and resources, as well as inevitable inaccuracies, inherent to their manual report preparation process.</p> <p>A mix of custom code and out of the box Microsoft BI functionality, including SharePoint and SQL Server Reporting Services, was the right fit for their reporting needs. We designed and implemented a solution that extracts transactional data from SAP, while SSRS feeds information directly into the SharePoint intranet. Employees are thrilled with the improved functionality and usability, and it can easily be scaled for future growth.</p> <p>For us, a great measure of client satisfaction is feedback from the end user. We had the opportunity to attend Hu-Friedy’s National Sales meeting to help launch the new reporting system – where it was greeted with a standing ovation by attendees. Instead of relying on spreadsheets and email, they can access current and archived reports on time and on demand. The days of waiting weeks to receive critical information are over. And at Hu-Friedy, they are delighted with the results.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sap-to-sharepoint-delivering-business-intelligence-reporting/">SAP to SharePoint: Delivering Business Intelligence Reporting</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>How do you evaluate the quality of the customer experience you&#8217;re providing to your consumers? This critical question is one of the most challenging faced by companies today. It is difficult to determine the correlation between design efforts and key performance indicators that measure return on investment for customer experience initiatives &#8211; but we believe that the organization that finds an answer will move to the top of the customer experience food chain.</p> <p>Every year, Forrester creates a Customer Experience Index (CXi), offering benchmarks to measure customer experience. They look at more than 150 large companies, creating detailed surveys that measure performance on three levels of the customer experience pyramid: doing business with companies that deliver value, are easy to engage with, and are enjoyable to interact with. Forrester develops their own rating scale and algorithm for calculating the performance of each organization, based on consumer responses.</p> <p>One fascinating trend is that value-based brands such as Courtyard by Marriot, Costco, and Target perform very well. In fact, discount retailer Marshalls scored the top ranking for 2013. Some might attribute this success to the weak economy, but these companies have scored well since Forrester began publishing the CXi. It begs the question, what are value-based brands doing right to achieve an “Excellent” or a “Good” rating year after year?</p> <p>Other industries are not performing nearly as well, with TV and Internet service providers and health insurance companies filling out the bottom of the index. Health insurance companies averaged a ranking between 49 and 66 points on a 100 point scale – placing them squarely in the “Very Poor” category.</p> <p>Are these rankings accurate? It’s certainly worth a closer look. Consumer perception can vary greatly by industry. Variables such as customer bias or a lack of diversity in participating consumer segments can impact results, particularly when the survey covers only 150 companies. Further, as we mention above, it is difficult to establish a direct correlation between the impact of specific customer experience design efforts and return on investment – or a bump in CXi rankings.</p> <p>As such, many organizations may not find the CXi useful – but we tend to disagree. In addition to highlighting the industries and companies who are customer experience pioneers, it gives us insight into why some retailers and hotels excel at providing customers with a better overall experience. We believe that the future is in understanding how value-based brands are improving the customer experience, and applying some of those ideas and techniques to the health insurance industry. As we implement some of these initiatives, health insurance industry CXi scores should improve across the board. Fools’ gold? We think not.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/forresters-customer-experience-index-valuable-insight-or-fools-gold/">Forrester&#8217;s Customer Experience Index: Valuable Insight or Fools&#8217; Gold?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>With the launch of SharePoint 2013, Microsoft introduced the SharePoint App Model – a new way to add functionality to your SharePoint-based sites. There are tons of good articles digging into the App Model, so we’ll cover the highlights here and provide links to more details.</p> <p><strong>THE BASICS</strong><br /> You can think of apps for SharePoint the same way you think of apps for your iPhone, Android, or Windows Phone. Just like apps for a phone or tablet (such as a game or banking application), apps for SharePoint provide a specific piece of functionality that enhance the capabilities of the SharePoint site in which it is used. You might have an app on your phone that provides weather information; likewise, a SharePoint app can be placed on your intranet to display the weather for the user’s zip code. The image below shows some recently popular SharePoint apps on the <a title="Microsoft Office Store" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps-for-sharepoint-FX102804987.aspx" target="_blank">Office Store</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SPApps1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1130" alt="SharePoint Apps" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SPApps1.png" /></a></p> <p><strong>APPS vs. WEB PARTS</strong><br /> Just as SharePoint users have become accustomed to talking about web parts, Microsoft has changed the game from web parts to apps. A common question involves the difference between apps and web parts.</p> <p>From an end user perspective, web parts and apps are similar – they both provide a way to add functionality to a SharePoint-based web site.  Once created, they can be leveraged on multiple sites with proper deployment and configuration.</p> <p>The primary difference between apps and web parts is how they are developed and deployed.  Web parts are built to run within SharePoint and are deployed directly to SharePoint Servers.  Apps run outside of the SharePoint environment and are simply added to SharePoint sites. One benefit of this is that poorly built apps will not impact your site like poorly built web parts can.</p> <p><strong>WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF APPS?</strong><br /> Apps have several distinct advantages. Since apps do not run on a SharePoint server, they will not impact your SharePoint server if they are poorly built. Additionally, adding apps to sites does not complicate the management and maintenance of your SharePoint environment. The app store provides a convenient way for you to purchase applications that have been validated by Microsoft, and an App Catalog (see the description below) is an easy way to share and control functionality across an enterprise. Another benefit is that upgrading a SharePoint environment containing apps should be easier than upgrading a SharePoint environment containing custom code developed by other approaches, since it is easier for your developers to maintain backward compatibility. Finally, your developers can use industry standard technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop apps and do not need as much detailed knowledge about SharePoint. You can see more advantages broken out by users, administrators and developers in this <a title="The Microsoft MVP Award Program Blog" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2013/01/21/sharepoint-2013-apps-advantages.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft blog</a>.</p> <p><strong>WHO BUILDS APPS and WHERE ARE THE APPS?</strong><br /> Apps are built by your developers, by consultants/contractors you hire, and by third parties. These apps are stored either on <a title="Microsoft Office Store" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps-for-sharepoint-FX102804987.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft’s Office Store</a> or in your organization’s own App Catalog. Just like apps for your phone and tablet, apps on the Office Store are provided by third parties and have costs that vary from free to hundreds of dollars. Your company can create its own App Catalog to store the apps you’ve developed. This gives your users a centralized place to locate approved functionality they can easily add to the SharePoint sites they manage.  Apps that are created in one area of your company are now easy to share across the organization.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SPApps2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1131" alt="SharePoint Apps" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SPApps2.png" /></a></p> <p><strong>ON-PREMISES or CLOUD</strong><br /> If you’ve read the previous blog on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-in-the-cloud/">SharePoint 2013 in the Cloud</a>, you know that Microsoft is pushing SharePoint Online and making sure SharePoint Online capabilities are as robust as those in the on-premises versions. In keeping with this goal, both on-Premises and SharePoint Online environments can take advantage of apps.</p> <p><strong>ARE APPS THE BEST THING EVER?</strong><br /> No, they are not. While we’ve listed many features and associated advantages, Microsoft still has work to do in this area. For example, apps run in an iFrame on the web page, which can lead to a variety of challenges (such as having an entire SharePoint page gray out when a modal dialog is displayed). And as you might expect, the App Store does not contain many apps at this point. The store is relatively new and third party developers want to see the value in creating apps before they dedicate time to creating them.</p> <p>We&#8217;ve talked about the highlights and this post should give you a basic understanding of the SharePoint App Model &#8211; you can learn more in this <a title="Apps for SharePoint overview" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/apps/fp179930(v=office.15).aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft article</a>.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-apps-six-reasons-you-should-care/">SharePoint 2013 Apps: Six Reasons You Should Care</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Is the delay of the Small Business Health Options Program a sign of things to come? As October approaches and 2,300 pages of complex legislation take form, I think we can all expect a few more surprises along the way. The latest news about SHOP confirms that the world of health insurance will probably get more complicated before getting better. Let’s take a closer look at the recent announcement.</p> <p>The primary reason for the delay distills down to choice. In its current setup, the 33 state exchanges operated fully or in part by the federal government will not have enough plans to generate healthy competition amongst insurers, resulting in higher premiums and fewer options. With that in mind, the decision was made to postpone the program in favor of giving both the employer and employee more choice.</p> <p>The interesting twist is that, even with the delay, the SHOP program still goes into effect this year, and employers are able to leverage the program if they choose. Another wrinkle in this latest announcement has to do with state-run exchanges, which may enact their own SHOP program within the original deadline. So at the end of the day, it looks like we’ll now have multiple flavors of the Small Business Health Options Program.</p> <p>Like I said… more complicated before it gets better.</p> <p>What is now more clear than ever is that having everything ‘figured out’ before October of 2013 is an unrealistic goal for any insurer. The payers that can adapt and react to changes (as it occurs) will be the players that thrive in a post-reform world. Easier said than done for companies that are historically built like majestic rock cliffs, not rolling stones.</p> <p>We’ll learn more about this announcement on April 22, and only time will tell where we go from there. Stay tuned….</p> <p>Photo Credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelduxbury/5824469025/">#96</a></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/shop-delays-a-sign-of-things-to-come/">SHOP Delays: A Sign of Things to Come?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

]]>
<![CDATA[
– but we deliberately skipped Web Content Management (WCM) features in that post, since SharePoint 2013 introduces so many improvements in this area. The top new WCM features in SharePoint 2013 bolster SharePoint’s capabilities for both intranets and public websites. However, not all features are included in each version of SharePoint (Online, Foundation, Standard and Enterprise), so be sure to validate that the features you require are available in your company’s version. Some of the most useful WCM features in SharePoint 2013 include:</p> <p><strong>AUTHORING IMPROVEMENTS</strong><br /> A web content management system is only as good as the authoring capabilities it provides. Limited features and poor usability frustrate content managers and result in less frequent content updates, hard to read content, and poor adoption by end-users. SharePoint 2013 has improved content authoring in many ways over previous versions of SharePoint.</p> <p>In SharePoint 2013, content managers can now copy content directly from Microsoft Word and paste it into a SharePoint web part with confidence that it will look good in a browser. Copying and pasting into Notepad was a common practice to remove formatting before copying into SharePoint, because otherwise results in SharePoint would be unpredictable at best. Now content managers can save time and get more accurately formatted content.</p> <p>SharePoint 2013 also improves features related to adding videos to site pages.  The uploading process is improved, as is the thumbnail creation process.</p> <p>Image renditions also improve authoring capabilities. Simply put, image rendition allows you to display different sized versions of an image on different pages.  This means you can easily display thumbnail images on an overview page while showing the full sized image on an article page. Site performance can also improve as large images are not always displayed on the browser.</p> <p><strong>BRANDING</strong><br /> Many front-end designers are breathing a sigh of relief with the changes SharePoint 2013 introduces in site branding. Now, designers are able to brand SharePoint using the tools they want to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (during last year’s SharePoint Conference, Microsoft made a point of using Adobe Dreamweaver to create the HTML/CSS files which were then brought directly into SharePoint). This means designers and front-end developers need to know less about SharePoint and can focus more on their core skills &#8211; front-end design and development.</p> <p><strong>DEVICE TARGETING</strong><br /> Device Targeting, or Device Channels, are a way for you to display the same content differently on various devices such as smartphones, tables, and laptops. Since both intranets and public websites are viewed much more often on mobile devices, this device targeting is valuable for a wide range of sites. Read more about the details on device targeting in our post on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/go-mobile-with-sharepoint-2013-the-top-5-features/">Mobile Features of SharePoint 2013</a> or in this Microsoft article, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161352.aspx">What&#8217;s new for mobile devices in SharePoint 2013</a>.</p> <p><strong>CONTENT SEARCH WEB PART</strong><br /> We detailed the Content Search Web Part in our post about <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-search-features/">Top Search Features in SharePoint 2013</a>. This feature is worth mentioning here because it allows for search driven sites, which can improve usability, adoption, and personalization. Any content that SharePoint is indexing can be made available to your intranet or public facing website through this web part.</p> <p><strong>FRIENDLY URLS</strong><br /> In SharePoint 2013 Microsoft has finally introduced the ability to give pages friendly URLs. This means URLs like <a href="http://www.yoursite.com/Pages/product.aspx#/ID=453">http://www.yoursite.com/Pages/product.aspx#/ID=453</a> and be replaced with URLs like <a href="http://www.yoursite.com/products/productA">http://www.yoursite.com/products/productA</a>. These URLs are more friendly and usable for your users and for search engines.</p> <p><strong>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) FEATURES</strong><br /> In addition to friendly URLs, SharePoint 2013 has introduced other SEO features that used to require code work-arounds. Publishing pages now give you the ability to set several attributes about the page, including:</p> <ul> <li>Name</li> <li>Title</li> <li>Browser Title (used in organic search results)</li> <li>Meta Description (sometimes used in organic search results)</li> <li>Keywords</li> <li>Exclude from Internet Search Engines</li> </ul> <p>Besides being directly set for a page, these properties can also be pulled from a Term Set in the Managed Metadata. This provides the ability to dynamically populate these SEO important fields.</p> <p><strong>CROSS-SITE PUBLISHING</strong><br /> This powerful feature allows you to create and maintain content in one SharePoint site collection and then display it in other site collections, a very efficient way to share content across sites. A couple common scenarios where this feature is beneficial include product catalogs displayed on the internet, knowledge base content shared with partners or suppliers on an extranet, and multi-lingual sites. The following diagram highlights the cross-site publishing capability.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WCM-Features.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1118" alt="WCM Features" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WCM-Features.png" /></a></p> <p>You can learn more about cross-site publishing in this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj163225.aspx">article from Microsoft</a>.</p> <p><strong>MULTI-LINGUAL SITE SUPPORT</strong><br /> While the variations feature is not new in SharePoint 2013, it is now used exclusively for multi-lingual sites. Using variations allows you to make content available to specific audiences (languages) based on the language setting of their web browser. The relationship between content on the source site and different language sites is tracked to enable the sites to be kept in sync. A new integrated translation service provides content managers the ability to specify automatic (machine performed) or manual translation of content.</p> <p>This list of the new WCM features in SharePoint 2013 should give you a good idea on the focus Microsoft has put in this area – but remember, not all features are available in all version of SharePoint.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-web-content-management-features/">SharePoint 2013 Web Content Management Features</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

olves many manual steps such as phone calls, opening up tickets, and writing e-mails. Even more detrimental to the approval process is that participants are not collaborating effectively; it’s difficult to find out the status of a request, who is working to approve/reject the request, and significant effort is being repeated because information used to evaluate the request (e.g. a master list of already approved software) is not centralized.</p> <p>Workflow and Collaboration is a big part of what the SharePoint 2013 investment brings to the table. We’re going to utilize a few key SharePoint features to simplify the approval and improve collaboration. The features we’ll use are the List View Web Part, SharePoint Designer Workflows, and the new SharePoint 2013 Script Editor Web Part.</p> <p>Here’s our high-level, blog friendly, version of the approval in SharePoint. It involves three participants:</p> <ol> <li>An employee requesting software installation</li> <li>An Enterprise Architect (EA) evaluating the request, and eventually approving or rejecting it</li> <li>An IT Help Desk member installing software as dictated through approved requests</li> </ol> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfserviceoverview2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1103" alt="Self Service Overview" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfserviceoverview2.jpg" /></a></p> <p>In a few steps we’ll help our client collaborate by:</p> <ol> <li>Making the master list of approved/rejected software available to everyone</li> <li>Communicating status of the request to employees</li> <li>Notifying owners of tasks and due dates</li> <li>Making it simple for employees to request software</li> </ol> <p><strong>BUILDING THE SOLUTION</strong></p> <p><strong>List View Web Part</strong></p> <p>The Software Master List is very simple. It contains details about all software products deployed in the organization, and an ‘Approved’ flag to filter which software is or is not approved.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicefields.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1108" alt="Self Service Fields" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicefields.jpg" /></a></p> <p>Employees visiting the site will go to a Software Self Service Page. That page contains a List View Web Part which is the Software Master List filtered for the Active field set to ‘Yes’.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicelvwp.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1109" alt="Self Service LVWP" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicelvwp.jpg" /></a></p> <p>From this page, every employee in the company can find out if the software they’re looking for is already approved, or if they’ll need to request software that is new to the organization.</p> <p>We’ll get to the “Request Existing” and “Request New” buttons in a bit, but first let’s dive into the workflow and list architecture.</p> <p><strong>SharePoint Designer Workflows</strong></p> <p>There are three lists used to facilitate the approval:</p> <ul> <li>Software Install Requests – contains all employee requests to install new software that is not approved in the Software Master list.</li> <li>Software Review Requests – contains all employee requests to install new software that is approved in the Software Master list</li> <li>Software Installation Tasks – contains tasks that are associated with Software Install/Review request from employees</li> </ul> <p>We can now visualize the workflow process in the image above in terms of SPD workflows that trigger task assignments and e-mails based on our list items’ create and change events.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/selfservicelongscale.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-274" alt="" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/selfservicelongscale.png" width="605" height="480" /></a></p> <p>Note that the Software Installation Tasks list has a lookup field back to the Software Review and Software Install Requests list, so the EA and IT representatives can easily view the details of the request:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicelinked.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1110" alt="Self Service Linked" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicelinked.png" /></a></p> <p>So, what about the Script Editor Web Part (SEWP)? That was used to build the “Request Existing” and “Request New” buttons below the List View Web Part.</p> <p><strong>Script Editor Web Part</strong></p> <p>Employees never need to leave the Software Self Service page to create items in the Software Install/Review Requests lists. Instead, the two buttons launch those lists’ new forms in a modal dialog directly from the portal page.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicemodal.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1111" alt="Self Service Modal" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicemodal.png" /></a></p> <p>One can do this with just a few lines of code using the SharePoint 2013 Script Editor Web Part (SEWP). Note that you can do this in SharePoint 2010 too. In SP2010, you’d use the Content Editor Web Part (CEWP), but that wasn’t really the core scenario for that web part. It seems Microsoft saw users overloading the CEWP to add script to pages, so now we get a nice clean web part focused on just that scenario – the SEWP. Here’s a screenshot of the part in edit mode and the code:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicepreview.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1112" alt="Self Service Preview" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/selfservicepreview.jpg" /></a></p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/serlfservicecode.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1113" alt="Self Service Code" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/serlfservicecode.jpg" /></a></p> <p>In short, we were able to boost collaboration using the List View Web Part, a few simple SPD workflows, and some novice code in the SEWP. Some key improvements:</p> <ul> <li>The List View Web Part made approved items from the Software Master List available to everybody</li> <li>The SPD workflows automated task assignment, provided visibility into approval status, and improved communication</li> <li>The Script Editor Web Part needed just a few lines of code increase adoption, and ultimately collaboration, by improving the user experience.</li> </ul> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-collaboration-self-service-portal-and-approvals/">SharePoint 2013 Collaboration &#8211; Self-Service Portal and Approvals</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Tahoe Partners and our client, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, recently participated in a Microsoft Risk and Health Assessment for SharePoint server (SPRAP).  The SPRAP was developed to provide in-depth analysis of SharePoint Products and Technologies configurations, custom code, and operational procedures, and critically, to uncover areas of potential risk to server stability, or not aligned with Microsoft best practices. We were pleased to receive an extremely positive report from the Microsoft SPRAP Engineer, and thought we would share some of our recommendations for maintaining a high-performing enterprise SharePoint deployment.</p> <p>All too often we see hastily implemented SharePoint environments that disregard Microsoft Best Practices, lack operational documentation and are performing at a sub-optimal level. How can you mitigate risk and help to ensure your enterprise SharePoint deployment is performing at its best? We&#8217;ve cut through the long list of best practices to pull out some key checkpoints you can use to improve the health of your SharePoint environment today:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SharePoint Products and Technologies Configuration</strong><br /> Keep in mind that the hardware requirements published on TechNet for SharePoint Server are the absolute minimums for a healthy running SharePoint implementation. Microsoft offers a guide to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262485(v=office.14).aspx">properly resource your enterprise SharePoint farm</a>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SharePoint Products and Technologies Customizations</strong><br /> Most enterprise SharePoint environments have customizations, but not all have verified that their custom code is up to par. Here’s how you can <a href="https://caf.sharepoint.microsoftonline.com/">detect and fix issues in your custom code</a>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Operations</strong><br /> Maintaining a healthy SharePoint environment goes hand in hand with being up to date. <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/ff800847.aspx">Stay current with SharePoint updates and Windows critical updates</a>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong><br /> Ensure that your recovery time objective (RTO) can be met &#8211; <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc891489(v=office.14).aspx">enforce storage governance with Quotas</a>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Security</strong><br /> Security is one of the most important SharePoint best practices for large enterprise environments, but unfortunately also one of the most ignored. For optimal security, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263445(v=office.14).aspx">use the least privileged service account model</a>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Performance</strong><br /> Looking to squeeze every last bit of performance out of your SharePoint environment? <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh292622.aspx">Design SQL Server storage for optimal throughput and manageability</a>.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-best-practices-conduct-your-own-risk-and-health-assessment/">SharePoint Best Practices: Conduct your own Risk and Health Assessment</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>When we returned from Hatch Digital Forum, <a title="Lessons (and a Winner!) from Hatch Digital Forum" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/lessons-and-a-winner-from-hatch-digital-forum/" target="_blank">we wrote about the significant trends</a> that emerged throughout the conference. What we heard, reiterated by some outstanding speakers, confirmed what we’ve seen in our work &#8211; that health reform, growing consumerism, and increasing mobile access are driving significant change in the health insurance industry. So it was particularly exciting to end the conference by speaking on Customer Experience &amp; Digital Innovation, sharing the story of Health Care Service Corporation’s efforts in creating a best-in-class consumer experience.</p> <p>We shocked the audience a bit, sharing a study from Bain &amp; Co. showing that, among firms that identified themselves as having a superior customer experience, only 8% actually had customers who agreed. There is no doubt that the health insurance industry is in transition – traditional and non-traditional competitors are getting more aggressive in filling customer experience gaps, and customer experiences are fragmented and disjointed across conventional and digital channels.</p> <p>Recognizing these challenges, HCSC focused on understanding the consumer and their journey through the customer lifecycle, using People, Process, and Technology to close gaps. Extensive research on the digital consumer told them that customers want education to facilitate the shopping process, and simple, easy to understand tools and content. Guiding the customer through major life changes, such as a job loss, is critical.</p> <p>One thing we’ve learned is that the engagement model is an evolutionary process. You need to be sure to understand where you are and from there, build a roadmap toward future plans. In other words, make sure you’ve covered the basics before chasing the bright, shiny object of the latest cutting-edge feature. For HCSC, that meant identifying quick wins, and leveraging those demonstrated successes to garner executive support for additional funding. Since beginning this initiative, they have seen measurable results, but are continually looking ahead to improve the customer experience.</p> <p>For those interested in learning more about Customer Experience and Digital Innovation, we’re pleased to post the contents of our Hatch Digital Forum presentation. Special thanks to co-presenters Tanya Mena from HCSC and Chris Althoff from Invoyent for permission to share.

<![CDATA[
<p>In this week’s Top SharePoint 2013 Features, we are taking a closer look at Enterprise Content Management. While SharePoint 2010 provided basic Enterprise Collaboration Management capabilities, Microsoft has made significant updates in SharePoint 2013. This is an exciting development, as we are seeing more companies consider SharePoint for ECM. In this post, we’ll focus exclusively on ECM, saving Web Content Management (WCM) features for another blog post.</p> <p><strong>EDISCOVERY and HOLD</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/eDiscovery-SP-ECM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1071" alt="eDiscovery SharePoint" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/eDiscovery-SP-ECM-1024x494.png" /></a></p> <p>eDiscovery and holds are important components in an ECM system, and this is one of the areas where Microsoft made the most changes in SharePoint 2013, starting with a new eDiscovery Center site template used to create a portal for managing discovery cases. SharePoint 2013 also adds in-place holds for both SharePoint sites and Exchange mailboxes. These holds can be placed down to the page and list item level &#8211; users can still work with the content while it is on hold because SharePoint captures a read-only copy for compliance officers to access. This is a major improvement that prevents user disruption during legal processes.</p> <p>If you have a SharePoint environment with multiple farms, you can benefit from the expanded eDiscovery capability that allows queries across multiple SharePoint farms. Again, this covers SharePoint sites as well as Exchange and file shares. And when the legal department needs to gather all discovered content, there is a new export feature available that covers both SharePoint 2013 and Exchange 2013 content.  You may have noticed the pattern &#8211; Microsoft has made an effort to have eDiscovery functionality cover other storage locations (like Exchange), and not just SharePoint.</p> <p>Check out this Microsoft article for more details on the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161513(v=office.15)">eDiscovery features of SharePoint 2013</a>.</p> <p><strong>SITE-BASED RETENTION</strong><br /> SharePoint 2013 takes the important compliance features available in SharePoint 2010 and makes them available at the site level.  This means you have much more granular control of how retention policies are applied, when a project is closed, and how content from the site is expired, including site mailboxes that are associated with sites (see below for more details).</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Site-Policies-SP-ECM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1072" alt="Site Policies SharePoint" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Site-Policies-SP-ECM.png" width="365" height="306" /></a><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Site-Settings-SP-ECM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1073" alt="Site Settings SharePoint" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Site-Settings-SP-ECM-300x197.png" width="300" height="197" /></a></p> <p><strong>SITE MAILBOXES/TEAM FOLDERS</strong><br /> Site Mailboxes allow you to consolidate content that is located in SharePoint and Exchange. This provides a single location to view and manage content from either of these systems. The lifecycle can be controlled using the site-based retention policies mentioned above.</p> <p><strong>PARTNER ECOSYSTEM</strong><br /> One of SharePoint’s greatest strengths lies in its partner ecosystem, including implementation partners and software partners, and its ability to integrate with a wide variety of systems. While this applies to many areas of SharePoint, in the ECM world, it means powerful integration between SharePoint and vendors providing industry-leading ECM capabilities. For example, there are many excellent providers of imaging technologies that integrate seamlessly with SharePoint. Additionally, large scale ECM requires extremely robust compliance practices. When SharePoint alone isn’t enough, Microsoft partners like <a href="http://www.avepoint.com/compliance-guardian/">AvePoint have tools</a> to enhance SharePoint’s capabilities. In almost all cases, you can be sure if a specific ECM capability isn’t included in SharePoint out of the box, a partner or third party product has already filled that gap.</p> <p>Next week we’ll continue reviewing new features in the ECM umbrella by focusing on Web Content Management features.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-enterprise-content-management-features-in-sharepoint-2013/">Top Enterprise Content Management Features in SharePoint 2013</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Not to sound alarmist but… the newly insured are coming! With open enrollment a few short months away, insurers must be prepared for a new individual customer base, one that will have different needs than existing customers.  This is significant, especially when considering your digital portfolio.  Will your website drive customers to purchase online?  Are you providing a delightful user experience that will encourage users to self-service (and help you manage your costs)?  Is your mobile strategy aligned with these needs?</p> <p>According to research from PwC’s Health Research Institute, the newly insured will have several key characteristics:</p> <ul> <li><strong>They will be less educated</strong> – approximately 86% won’t have a college degree compared to 63% of the current population.  Education will be critical to the shopping process – well written, easy to understand content that avoids jargon will help users understand complex insurance terminology and concepts.</li> <li> <strong>They will be more diverse in background and language</strong> – 25% will be non-white compared to 21%, and 30% will speak a language other than English. Think about offering your website in languages other than English, and addressing subtle language nuances (vs. direct translation). Make sure your site feature a variety of imagery that is inclusive of your entire customer base.</li> <li><strong>They are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed</strong> – the newly insured will be less likely (42%) to have a full time job compared to current customers (59%), and will generally earn less. Following a user through job changes will be essential to providing a consistent experience. How will your digital channels help facilitate the employment change process?  It should be easy for them to stay with you as they move from group to individual and back and between coverage plans. Keep one consistent member record, and remember their history even as they leave and return. Many will churn between Medicaid and the subsidized exchanges as their income level fluctuates – what type of digital experience will these users have with you?</li> </ul> <p>This is a very high-level look at the newly insured – no doubt we will learn more as October 2013 quickly approaches – but even these differentiators emphasize the need to review your digital strategy. They’re coming… are you ready?</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/countdown-to-october-is-your-digital-strategy-ready-for-the-newly-insured/">Countdown to October &#8211; is your digital strategy ready for the newly insured?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>We’re back from New Orleans, and if you’re like us, you’ve spent the last week thinking through all the great ideas you brought home from Hatch Digital Forum. Although we were there as a speaker and exhibitor, our ears are always open – especially when it comes to hearing how forward-thinking Blues plans are innovating to engage members and attract customers.</p> <p>There were a couple trends that we heard loud and clear. First, ‘big data’ is here to stay and many Blues are starting to collect and analyze this information to maximize marketing spend. Second, the health insurers who will win in the post-reform environment are the ones who are building a remarkable end-to-end experience across the customer lifecycle. The coming year offers uncertainty, but it is clear that it also presents much opportunity.</p> <p>And in that spirit of collaborative learning, we’ll be posting the deck from our talk on “Customer Experience &amp; Digital Innovation to Reduce Customer Friction, Improve Sales and Drive Down Cost” (with special thanks to co-presenters Tanya Mena from HCSC and Chris Althoff from Invoyent for permission to share). Check back next week to take a look&#8230;.</p> <p>Finally, if you stopped by our booth at Hatch to spin our prize wheel, you’re either the proud owner of a Magic 8 ball, entered to win an iPad mini, or if you’re lucky, both. We’re happy to announce that the winner of our iPad giveaway is… <strong>Sherry Gibbs </strong>from <strong>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City</strong>! Congratulations! Sherry, email <a href="mailto: russ.maloney@tahoepartners.com">Russ Maloney</a> and let us know where to send your new iPad.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/lessons-and-a-winner-from-hatch-digital-forum/">Lessons (and a Winner!) from Hatch Digital Forum</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>Customer engagement means many things to different people &#8211; some look at it as a strategic customer acquisition and retention process, while others view it as immersing customers in a brand through online social media. But what does customer engagement mean to the health insurance industry in a post-reform world?</p> <p>The landscape of who your customers are and how they interact with insurance providers will significantly change when open enrollment for the ACA begins. A larger portion of your customers will be direct market who, based on web and mobile usage patterns, will increasingly come to utilize online tools to purchase insurance and get service. They will expect more than just information, they will expect rich and mature retail and member portal experiences where they can compare products, perform routine tasks, and engage on social platforms.</p> <p>This makes an online presence with mature customer engagement functionality more critical than ever. You’ll need to offer your customers (and potential customers) robust tools to help them find the answers they are looking for.</p> <p><strong>On Tuesday, March 19, we will present a webinar</strong>, sharing some examples of what we&#8217;ve seen work well (and not work) in different areas of health care insurance organizations, and discussing the various levels of social engagement maturity in these areas. Come see how you rank. Tell us what you are working on, and ask questions of us and your peers. We look forward to talking with you!</p> <h5><strong><a title="Customer Engagement: Where do you rank?" href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1952538385999420672" target="_blank">Register today &gt;</a></strong></h5> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/customer-engagement-in-a-post-reform-world/">Customer Engagement in a Post-Reform World</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In this week’s installment of our SharePoint Top 5, we are highlighting SharePoint 2013 Online (with a bonus 6th item!). One thing you will notice is that many of these features are similar to the top features in the on-premises versions of SharePoint 2013.  This is by design – Microsoft is closing the gap in the feature set between online and on-premises SharePoint.  These are some of the top features of SharePoint 2013 Online.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL FEATURES</strong><br /> In <a title="Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Social Features" href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-social-features/" target="_blank">Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Social Features</a>, we covered many of the top social features in SharePoint 2013. That post did not differentiate between online and on-premises social features – and for good reason.  Everything mentioned also applies to SharePoint Online &#8211; Activity Streams, Microblogging, Yammer, Community Sites, and updated MySites are all part of SharePoint 2013 Online.</p> <p><strong>COLLABORATING WITH EXTERNAL USERS</strong><br /> Project and Team sites continue to be one of the most common uses for SharePoint. One popular step is to extend these sites to partners, vendors, suppliers, and others outside your company. SharePoint 2013 Online makes collaborating with external users easier than ever. Sharing with external users does not require a license, and you can determine if the user must sign in with a validated account or if you want to provide access through anonymous guest links. Either way, it is easy to provide sharing functionality through SharePoint.</p> <p><strong>CLOUD APP MODEL</strong><br /> SharePoint 2013 Online leverages the new Cloud App Model, enabling developers to create SharePoint apps. These apps are self-contained modules of functionality that extend the capabilities of a SharePoint website – think apps for your cell phone and tablet. Users browse and download apps from the <a href="http://officepreview.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps-for-sharepoint-FX102804987.aspx">SharePoint Store</a> or from your organization&#8217;s private App Catalog and install them on their SharePoint sites. Administrators control what can be installed, so you don’t sacrifice security or violate governance policies.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cloud-App-Model.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1046" alt="Cloud App Model" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cloud-App-Model.png" /></a></p> <p><strong>SKYDRIVE PRO</strong><br /> SkyDrive Pro is a document storage service that organizations<em> </em>establish and manage, enabling users to synchronize their work documents from SharePoint to the cloud, and to take documents offline when they&#8217;re on the go. One reason this is such a powerful feature is that people can now easily access and edit their documents across devices, and files are automatically synchronized with SkyDrive Pro when online. SkyDrive Pro is integrated into SharePoint Online and on-premises &#8211; both SharePoint and Office desktop applications (like Word and PowerPoint) can save documents directly to SkyDrive Pro. SkyDrive Pro provides Dropbox-like sharing functionality through SharePoint.</p> <p><strong>BUSINESS CONNECTIVITY SERVICES</strong><br /> Another important addition to SharePoint 2013 Online is the ability to use Business Connectivity Services (BCS) to bring external data into the SharePoint Online environment. This means you can access and display data from applications inside your company’s firewall (like ERP and CRM systems) on your SharePoint Online site. BCS has been available in on-premises SharePoint, but 2013 is the first release where some of these capabilities are available in the online version. Note that SharePoint Online does not provide all the BCS capabilities of on-premises, but expect Microsoft to keep increasing this online functionality.</p> <p><strong>ALL THE PERKS OF THE “CLOUD”</strong><br /> This article would not be complete without mentioning an obvious feature of SharePoint 2013 Online – Microsoft hosts and manages the infrastructure. Your SharePoint data is in highly secure, geographically distributed data centers with backup, disaster recovery and experts monitoring the environment.  Additionally, Microsoft has promised more aggressive update schedules for SharePoint Online compared to the on-premises version, so you will have earlier access to new features and functionality.</p> <p>Not all features are available in all SharePoint Online plans, so check out this article on <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819267.aspx">SharePoint Online features across Office 365 Plans</a> for details.</p> <p>In a future post, we’ll cover what’s missing between SharePoint 2013 Online and SharePoint 2013 on-premises, to help you make an informed decision as to which deployment model is right for your organization.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-in-the-cloud/">SharePoint 2013 in the Cloud</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

work, I was thinking about a real-world set up that would highlight the feature, and it wasn’t long before I literally drove right into a scenario. In Chicago, potholes are a big nuisance, and because of that the City of Chicago has a <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/report_a_pot_holeinstreet.html">Report a Pothole Site</a>. The site allows people to report locations of potholes and post a picture of the pothole as a visual reference, with the idea that City of Chicago employees will address users’ reports by fixing the potholes.</p> <p>Today, the site is geared towards desktop users: it has a lot of graphics and requires multiple clicks to load the report form (which also launches in a new window). It also requires users to specify the locations of potholes “manually” instead of taking advantage of available geolocation Web APIs – this results in reduced accuracy. Tahoe is designing a SharePoint based mobile form to replace the existing Report a Pothole form. We’ll enhance the experience for mobile by:</p> <ul> <li>Using JavaScript’s geolocation API to simplify the effort to report the pothole’s location and improve accuracy</li> <li>Using SharePoint’s geolocation field to visually render the exact location of the pothole through Bing maps</li> <li>Making the form lightweight with only the essential input fields</li> </ul> <p>And who knows, maybe this example will be so good that the City of Chicago will ask us to build this for real!</p> <p>We’re going to need to read images from users’ phones, so a script-only solution won’t suffice. As such, we have two solid options for the project type: a SharePoint 2013 Provider Hosted App or a SharePoint 2013 solution. Discussing the first project model is a blog topic unto itself, so we’ll keep this straightforward by using a SharePoint 2013 solution.</p> <p><strong>STEP 1: Setup the Environment to Support Bing Maps</strong></p> <p>The only pre-requisite we have is that a farm admin needs to register a Bing Maps key with the farm (or site or web). I’ll do this using the PowerShell technique outlined on Microsoft’s article explaining <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161355.aspx">how to use the location field type in mobile applications for SharePoint 2013</a>.</p> <p>Set-SPBingMapsKey –BingKey &lt;Bing Maps Key&gt;<br /> Note: In SharePoint Online, this step is not required.</p> <p><strong>STEP 2: Add the Pothole Reports List and Script Files</strong></p> <p>After the farm is configured, I’ll Launch Visual Studio 2013, and create a sandbox solution – I’ve named mine “Pothole Reports”.</p> <p>Once the project is created, the first step is to add the Pothole Reports list. My list consists of three fields and it has attachments enabled:</p> <ol> <li>Title – OOTB Title field</li> <li>Report Description – Note</li> <li>Pothole Location – Geolocation</li> </ol> <p>To add the list, I will use the Visual Studio 2013 UI. It was fairly easy to create lists in Visual Studio 2010, but Visual Studio 2013 provides a new GUI authoring environment that, IMO, makes creating lists even easier/quicker than it is in the SharePoint UI. Also, Visual Studio automatically removes spaces from the Display Name to generate the internal field name so we don’t have to waste time specifying both the ‘Name’ and ‘Display Name’ fields in our schema and/or deal with spaces’ hex value in our code (i.e. x0020). Finally, the Visual Studio list definition UI also makes the Geographic Location field type available to us out of the box, whereas one must otherwise <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj164050.aspx">add the field programmatically or through PowerShell</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potholelist.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" alt="Pothole List" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potholelist.png" width="638" height="227" /></a></p> <p>Now we have our list to store users’ reports. Next, I will add modules to store my JavaScript, CSS, and Image files. This project is going to require jQuery and jQuery Mobile, so I will get the necessary files added to my project. After they’re added, I’ll add the appropriate references in the site master page and move on to create the form.</p> <p><strong>STEP 3: Create the Mobile Form</strong></p> <p>We need only 2 input fields on our form – this experience is going to be as efficient for the mobile user as we can make it. The fields on the form will be Description and Picture, and I will render the form using a Visual Web part so that I can easily add this to a page in my Publishing site.</p> <p>First, I tweaked the master page a bit to optimize for a good anonymous mobile experience. A few of the key changes were to:</p> <ul> <li>Add the viewport metatag to auto-scale on the device-width to the head placeholder</li> <li>Hide the suiteBar, ribbonrow, titlerownew, sideNavBox, contentBox, and titlerow</li> <li>Overload the FixRibbonAndWorkspaceDimensions, ProcessImn, and ProcessImnMarkers JavaScript functions to stop SharePoint from trying to dynamically resize the page and from trying to add ActiveX controls</li> <li>Register the jQuery Mobile CSS and JavaScript, and register my own JavaScript files</li> </ul> <p>With that done, we begin form design. I added header, content, and footer sections, and inside of the content section I added the two user controls for capturing description and the picture to upload. The user’s latitude and longitude will be stored in hidden fields that I populate when the form first loads. Here’s a snapshot of the form and a snippet of the JavaScript used to store the user’s location.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potholeform.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1038" alt="Pothole Form" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potholeform.png" width="651" height="242" /></a></p> <p>var gps = navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function (position) {</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">var latitude = position.coords.latitude;</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">var longitude = position.coords.longitude;</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">$obj.val(latitude + &#8216;,&#8217; + longitude);</p> <p>});</p> <p><strong>STEP 4: Process User Submission</strong></p> <p>Inside of my Visual Web Part code, I’ll store the submitted description, picture, and user’s coordinates as a new list entry.</p> <p>Here is the interesting part of that code:<br /> try<br /> {</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">byte[] fileBytes = potholepicture.FileBytes;</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">if (fileBytes.Length &gt; 0)</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">{</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">// add the item (longitude x latitude in WKT format)</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">string[] lat_and_long = userlocation.Value.Split(&#8216;,&#8217;);</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">SPListItem myItem = myWeb.Lists["Pothole Reports"].Items.Add();</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">myItem["ReportDescription"] = potholedescription.InnerText;</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">myItem["PotholeLocation"] = &#8220;POINT(&#8221; + lat_and_long[1] + &#8221; &#8221; + lat_and_long[0] + &#8220;)&#8221;;</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">myWeb.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">myItem.Update();</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">// now, attach the picture</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">addFileToListItem(myItem.ParentList.Title, myItem.ID, potholepicture.FileName, fileBytes, myWeb);</p> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">myWeb.AllowUnsafeUpdates = false;</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">}</p> <p>}</p> <p><strong>STEP 5: Review List Entry</strong></p> <p>After the code above executes, there should be a new entry in our Pothole Reports list with the description and exact latitude/longitude of the pothole. That list item will also have a picture of the pothole attached.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potholereport.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039" alt="Pothole Report" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potholereport.png" width="609" height="379" /></a></p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>With jQuery Mobile and Visual Web Parts we were able to make an intuitive mobile form through which users can submit work-order requests to SharePoint. Using JavaScript’s geolocation API along with SharePoint’s new geolocation field, the data captured through user submission provides a precise location that is automatically visualized through Bing maps.</p> <p>From here, it would be easy to setup an event receiver or SPD workflow to send dispatch an e-mail about the new report with a link to the item view form, repair orders could be sent out with the click of a button, tasks could be generated to promote accountability and visibility, etc. The possibilities are endless.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/sharepoint-2013-mobile-forms-and-geolocation/">SharePoint 2013 &#8211; Mobile Forms and Geolocation</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>What is “accessibility?” We define accessibility as “the extent to which the information being presented is available and understandable by anyone.” One might argue that an application should be designed only for the target audience, but it should also be taken into consideration that audience members may have a visual or aural impairment and require the use of a “helper” like a screen reader or translation software. Is the content accessible publicly by everyone or in a controlled environment like a private workplace? In other words, it is important to know your audience.</p> <p>Your audience may or may not be obvious, but it is important to know who they are and what tools they use. If the product will be used by a very specific user type&#8211;an employee, for example&#8211;then you only need to consider the tools that are specific to the users in that environment. Questions to ask include, “What age group do our users belong to?” “Do any of my employees have disabilities?” “What are typical helper tools that this group may use?” Answers to these questions may be as simple as “eye glasses,” but some of your users may require the use of screen readers (for the blind).</p> <p>If the application or web site will be available to the public, it should be designed with the broadest audience in mind. Here are some accessibility issues to consider:</p> <ul> <li>Client functions <ul> <li>Browser magnification has grown in use since smart phones and tablets have become more prevalent. The availability of high definition on laptops and other smaller monitors have also caused the increased use of magnification in browsers.</li> <li>Opening new windows has had unreliable behavior as tabs have become popular in browsers.</li> <li>Modal windows and dialogs (a.k.a. “lightboxes”) have been known to cause issues with screen readers if implemented incorrectly.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Optical equipment <ul> <li>Monitors today come in more shapes and sizes than ever before. With high-definition monitors available on laptops, it’s difficult to imagine a user browsing your web site at a full 1920&#215;1080 on a 17” monitor&#8230; or is it?</li> <li>Projectors often don’t represent color as intended. Ensure that your important content can be viewed easily when being projected. Use high contrast for text (e.g., black on white).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Software <ul> <li>Consider the use of screen reading software for the blind. Any images that give context to your content should include textual representation.</li> <li>Some visually impaired users employ additional magnification software to view content on the screen.</li> <li>Some audience members may rely on language translators. You can avoid miscommunication by offering an alternative version of your content in multiple languages so that the user will not have to rely on software. This way, you can be sure to communicate the intended ideas rather than risk losing something in translation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hardware <ul> <li>Mobile or desktop browser? Be sure to make the content compatible across all platforms and enable responsive design on your content if it will be viewed on multiple devices.</li> <li>Will the content be viewed on a TV? With the growing popularity of devices like Google TV, gaming consoles, and smart TVs, web content is being displayed on television more than ever before.</li> </ul> </li> <li>People <ul> <li>Will your users require another human being to help them? The elderly often rely on younger helpers to assist them with accessing content. Ensure that your content is understandable to all possible parties.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Be sure to also observe accessibility compliance requirements if your audience may include users that have specific needs. For example, the standards in Section 508 are regulated by the government and require that people with disabilities have access to certain types of content.</p> <p>Accessibility is a critical element in designing anything, whether it is hardware, software, or content. Making sure that users can understand your product helps to reduce miscommunication and calls to the help desk. What’s more, exceptional accessibility naturally makes your product available to anyone, which is the bottom line for most businesses.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/five-things-to-think-about-accessibility/">Five Things to Think About: Accessibility</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>This week’s SharePoint 2013 Top 5 list looks at the latest mobile features in SharePoint 2013. While we all found mobile support in SharePoint 2010 lacking (to say the least), SharePoint 2013 has come a long way.  These are the features we see as most important – read on see if you think SharePoint 2013 has finally gone mobile.</p> <p><strong>MOBILE BROWSER EXPERIENCE</strong><br /> Depending on the mobile browser being used, SharePoint can provide different browsing options – the Classic View, the Contemporary View and the Full Screen UI.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SP2013-Mobile-Views.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1015" alt="SP2013 Mobile Views" src="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SP2013-Mobile-Views.png" /></a></p> <p> The Contemporary View is new to SharePoint 2013. This view renders in HTML5 and is available to the newest mobile browsers &#8211; Mobile IE9.0+, iPhone’s Safari 4.0+ and Android 4.0+. It is a clean view with the goal of providing quick access to lists, document libraries, and other common SharePoint content. The classic view provides backward compatibility for older mobile browsers.  In this case, classic means old – it is the same mobile view that was available in SharePoint 2010. While functional, it is meant for a specific purpose, and it is not going to win any user design awards.  The Full Screen UI is exactly what the name says – a full desktop view of the site shown on the mobile device.</p> <p><strong>DEVICE CHANNELS</strong><br /> Device Channels are a way for you to choose how the same content displays on different devices. If you tried to support mobile browsers on early versions of SharePoint  you know you either had a single mobile view or you went through numerous workarounds to get browser specific content. SharePoint 2013 cleans it up. Your master pages, page layouts, and style sheets can be mapped to specific mobile browsers, allowing much more control over the display of your content.</p> <p>While the list of mobile browsers is limited, it includes the popular ones such as iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone. Details on supported browsers can be found on <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161353%28v=office.15%29.aspx">Microsoft’s Technet site</a>.</p> <p><strong>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</strong><br /> Say you often work with a SharePoint library, and want to be notified on your mobile device when a new or changed document is posted to that list. Alert functionality has been around for a while and can send you an email or text, but SharePoint 2013 takes it a step further by providing the plumbing so users can receive notifications on their mobile devices when specific activities occur on a SharePoint site. This is a powerful tool to keep users informed of key changes to SharePoint-based sites and business solutions. Imagine you have an idea capture and management solution built in SharePoint 2013. You can now automatically push notifications to the employee who submitted the idea each time the status of that idea changes. This is a great way to engage users and increase overall use of your solutions.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the app on the mobile device must be specifically built to leverage this notification feature. Expect more and more apps that leverage SharePoint to incorporate push notifications into their standard functionality.</p> <p><strong>LOCATION (or GEOLOCATION)</strong><br /> Whether you call it location or geolocation, SharePoint 2013 now contains a geolocation field type that can be included in a list. This has numerous applications, such as automatically logging the location of a user each time they enter information.  This is a powerful feature for SharePoint-based applications where mobile users are capturing information through their phone or tablet. You can display this location information via Bing Maps (not Google Maps or other popular mapping services).</p> <p>There is a notable drawback to this feature.   This new field type isn&#8217;t available through the standard UI list building tools. Instead, it must be inserted programmatically. Most situations where you will use this field type will require coding anyways, so this drawback isn&#8217;t as serious as it initially appears.</p> <p><strong>OFFICE WEB APPS</strong><br /> Do you find yourself accessing SharePoint-based documents more than ever on your mobile device? If this is true for you or your users, you’ll like the changes to Office Web Apps in SharePoint 2013. Now SharePoint 2013 and the Office Web Apps Server work together better than ever before to provide a higher quality experience for users who interact with documents on their phones. This covers Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, and the viewer for these documents is now optimized for phones.  Could you view these types of documents on SharePoint 2010 using Office Web Apps? Yes, but it wasn&#8217;t as user-friendly as it is now. We hope that Microsoft continues to enhance this experience, since viewing and editing documents on our mobiles devices is becoming much more common.</p> <p>There are changes from SharePoint 2010 with how the installation is done (and how many servers are needed) to enable these features, so make sure your infrastructure and admin teams know you want this functionality.</p> <p>Of course, Microsoft realizes that access via mobile devices is the way of the future, so they have attempted to add support to make mobile use of SharePoint easy and user-friendly. They&#8217;ve given improved out of the box capabilities, like the contemporary view, and powerful tools for site designers and developers to use to provide very custom experiences to different users.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/go-mobile-with-sharepoint-2013-the-top-5-features/">Go Mobile with SharePoint 2013 &#8211; the Top 5 Features</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>As health insurers prepare for a wave of new members in 2014, they are investing significant dollars and resources in new and revamped online member portals. So why aren&#8217;t more members registering?</p> <p>We know that online engagement pivots on the days (even hours) before and after a shopper submits an application, so insurers are looking to:</p> <ul> <li>Build a seamless experience converting shoppers into members.</li> <li>Leverage mobile resources to engage members at the point of sale.</li> <li>Reduce call center volumes by giving members answers to common onboarding questions.</li> <li>Make members feel like valued customers.</li> <li>Maximize ROI on their member portal.</li> </ul> <p>When thinking through the member welcoming process, consider how you can best leverage all available channels, such as web, mobile, etc. to drive member engagement – and reduce costs through increased portal use and self-service.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/its-not-member-onboarding-its-member-welcoming/">It&#8217;s Not Member Onboarding &#8211; It&#8217;s Member Welcoming</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

]]>

n the office puts everything back into question. If we ever wondered what might make great kindling for blowing up in the social media sphere, we certainly know now.</p> <p>I’m sure there are plenty of reasons this policy shift sounds great from within the insulated walls of the executive sanctuary, but from the streets outside it sounds eerily like raising the corporate thermostat to a toasty 90 degrees to get more out of presumably already hard working employees. I’m sure there are a few old timers expressing their delight right now that we’ve stepped back in time about 20 years. Who knows, maybe Yahoo will retain its top talent and get a boost in workforce productivity. We’re not here to judge, but we’ll offer 3 reasons why this doesn’t make sense from our perspective.</p> <p><strong>Availability of tools, tools and more tools for collaboration. </strong><br /> Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox. Granted most of these tools have a consumer orientation, but replace the names with Lync, SharePoint, Yammer and SkyDrive (or your own corporate flavor) and one quickly realizes that while the world is moving in one direction, Yahoo has found the flux capacitor and is going back in time. People can talk, share information, post updates, find experts, collaborate and even “see” each other from anywhere at any time. One might argue that office space is becoming a relic of the past.</p> <p><strong>Innovation and product development are happening globally and around the clock.</strong><br /> Talk to most stodgy old manufacturers or a software company, hmmm… and you’ll quickly hear about global collaboration. Ideation through product launch more than ever is being managed in virtual environments that don’t care about time zone or physical presence, allowing sophisticated ideas to be nurtured, engineered and produced. We’ve seen companies <a title="http://www.tahoepartners.com/SitePages/Section.aspx?Root=Solutions:Case%20Studies:Subsection&amp;ShowDetail=1&amp;ContentID=143" href="http://www.tahoepartners.com/SitePages/Section.aspx?Root=Solutions:Case%20Studies:Subsection&amp;ShowDetail=1&amp;ContentID=143" target="_blank">accelerate their speed to market by close to 70%</a>, not by sitting next to each other, but through the use of highly collaborative solutions with well managed processes.</p> <p><strong>Ideas are being identified, fostered, and implemented independent of physical boundaries. </strong><br /> More than ever, the democratization of ideas flourishes. You don’t need to be a senior executive, or sitting across from one, to have your good idea heard and acted on. We can tell you about a company that <a title="http://www.tahoepartners.com/SitePages/Section.aspx?Root=Solutions:Case%20Studies:Subsection&amp;ShowDetail=1&amp;ContentID=156" href="http://www.tahoepartners.com/SitePages/Section.aspx?Root=Solutions:Case%20Studies:Subsection&amp;ShowDetail=1&amp;ContentID=156" target="_blank">identified real savings of over $5M annually</a> by giving its product engineers a platform to collaborate virtually.</p> <p>Maybe we’re the ones that saw a fork in the road and took it, as Yogi Berra so articulately said. Or, maybe Yahoo just took a U-turn. <a title="http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-says-that-marissa-mayer-got-it-wrong-about-remote-employees-2013-2?0=warroom" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-says-that-marissa-mayer-got-it-wrong-about-remote-employees-2013-2?0=warroom" target="_blank">Here’s what Virgin’s Richard Branson had to say</a><strong>. <a title="https://twitter.com/tahoepartners" href="https://twitter.com/tahoepartners" target="_blank">Let us know what you think.</a></strong></p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/3-reasons-yahoo-still-doesnt-get-it/">3 Reasons Yahoo Still Doesn’t Get It</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>When Microsoft announced the release of SharePoint 2013 last fall, the question we heard most often was “what’s new and different?” With the official launch expected any day, we’re highlighting some of the new and noteworthy upgrades to SharePoint 2013. This week: a closer look at the Top

5 social features in SharePoint 2013, and how they fill the gaps SharePoint 2010 had with social capabilities.</p> <p><strong>COMMUNITY SITES </strong><br /> Communities have been standard in social platforms like <a title="NewsGator" href="http://www.newsgator.com/" target="_blank">NewsGator</a> and Yammer for years, and now SharePoint 2013 is adding these capabilities. With SharePoint 2013, you can create communities for members of a project team, an enterprise-wide process, a user group, or any other group with a purpose. Members can comment, reply, and grow their reputation within the community while teams stay more connected. Top contributors are easily highlighted so you know who is active and a leader within the community.</p> <p><strong>ACTIVITY STREAM / MICROBLOGGING</strong><br /> <strong></strong>Microsoft calls this their Newsfeed feature – basically, the Facebook or Twitter-like ability to post comments for others to see and view colleagues’ activities. Employees can follow comments, documents, and communities to keep in touch with what is happening in the areas that are most important to them. For example, when a user you are following saves a document in SharePoint, you see this activity in real-time in your Newsfeed, and can preview the document without opening it. Likes, replies, mentions, and hash tags stimulate conversation across organizational boundaries.</p> <p><strong>YAMMER</strong><br /> Yammer is not new with SharePoint 2013, but this is the first release of SharePoint since Microsoft acquired Yammer in 2012. Yammer is, and had always been, strictly a cloud-based product, so it makes sense that the initial integration between SharePoint and Yammer will focus on the online version of SharePoint 2013. Office365 comes prepackaged with Yammer Enterprise at a reduced price, so using Yammer and SharePoint together is becoming easier to do. Additionally, Yammer web parts integration is included with the on-premise version of SharePoint. You can expect to see more from Microsoft on tighter integration between SharePoint and Yammer.</p> <p><strong>MY SITE IMPROVEMENTS</strong><br /> SharePoint 2013 expands My Site’s capabilities to include more personal and professional information, which allows users to find others with needed expertise. My Sites are where users access their personal Activity Stream and keep tabs on everything (people, documents, sites) that they are following. SkyDrive Pro is an enterprise version of Microsoft’s consumer SkyDrive service, giving your employees a location in the cloud to store and share files. Employees can work on files offline and access them from home, hotels, and remote offices.</p> <p><strong>SEARCH GOES SOCIAL</strong><br /> Microsoft focused on expanding search capabilities in SharePoint 2013, and Social Search is one of the areas benefiting from this attention. Expertise search allows users to find authors of documents that contain material related to the search terms.  This allows employees to not only find people who list expertise in a profile, but also those who have demonstrated expertise by developing content. Further, people results and document results can be combined to make the search experience even more user friendly. Other search features include recommendations and higher placement for popular content.</p> <p>Microsoft has made great strides in providing SharePoint 2013 with rich social capabilities, and leading social platforms like NewsGator and Yammer continue to innovate and introduce new functionality. Companies looking to take social to the next level will need to determine if SharePoint 2013 alone will meet their immediate and future needs, or if a third party product on top of SharePoint will provide additional benefits.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-social-features/">Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Social Features</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>This week’s Top 5 takes a look at the improved user and business related search features in SharePoint 2013. In addition, there are numerous technical changes to SharePoint search which will be covered in a future post.</p> <p><strong>DOCUMENT PREVIEW</strong><br /> Document preview gives users
]]>
<![CDATA[
the ability to hover over search results and preview content without opening the document itself. Users are more productive, since they don’t need to open and search through each document to find what they are looking for. In addition, they are able to scroll through the entire document in the preview pane. In previous versions of SharePoint, this preview functionality was typically accomplished through third party tools or FAST, but it is now included in all editions of SharePoint 2013.   Of course, there are limitations. The preview functionality uses Office Web Apps to show the preview, which means two things. First, only Office documents can be previewed. This leaves PDFs and other common document types left out. Second, you must have an Office Web Apps server, which could have infrastructure and administration implications. However, despite these limitations, document preview is a great out-of-the-box feature for search users.</p> <p><strong>FAST IS BUILT-IN</strong><br /> Although we’re focusing on user and business related search features, we can’t write about SharePoint 2013 search without highlighting the fact that most of the FAST search capabilities are now built-in. So, you can look at it as SharePoint 2013 search combining the best of SharePoint 2010 search and FAST search. This means a much more powerful and scalable search for your users, with more functionality, faster results, broader search capability and more.</p> <p><strong>VISUAL REFINERS</strong><br /> A refiner is Microsoft’s term for additional filters or criteria that can be applied to further narrow search results. For example, a refiner could allow a user to filter search results to show only Microsoft Word documents or documents created in a certain date range.   Refiners are not new to SharePoint 2013, but Microsoft has put a nice visual interface on top to improve usability. For example, you can now use a slider to select a date range for documents rather than picking static options, such as “30-60 days”, from a list.  Additionally, refiners are more configurable in SharePoint 2013, meaning less customized work to enhance the search experience.</p> <p><strong>CONTENT SEARCH WEB PART</strong><br /> While some might categorize the Content Search Web Part (CSWP) as only a new web part, we consider this a great new search feature in SharePoint 2013. This is a powerful tool for enabling search driven sites, which enable personalization and promote stickiness. You can use this web part to display content on your intranet or internet site that comes from anywhere your SharePoint site is indexing, including content that is not in SharePoint.  You can also leverage SharePoint’s powerful search engine to capture exactly what you want to display on your site and, using the new Display Templates functionality, easily customize the display of the results. For example, you might use the CSWP is to deliver personalized recommendations to a user based on their previous viewing. This is very powerful and engaging for the user.</p> <p><strong>PERSONALIZED SEARCHING</strong><br /> SharePoint 2013 aims to make search more relevant to each user and the types of searching that user has done before. In SP2013, query suggestions now include items learned from a user’s behavior, and search results contain Personal Favorites, search results tailored to the user based on past search activity.   Microsoft has made great strides with search capabilities in SharePoint 2013. These new search capabilities are geared toward improving the user’s search experience and therefore their overall experience within SharePoint.  And as we have seen time and again, we know that improved user experience will increase adoption.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/top-5-sharepoint-2013-search-features/">Top 5 SharePoint 2013 Search Features</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>

<p>When millions of Americans go to shop for insurance this fall, many will want to know how the Affordable Care Act impacts them. As an insurer, providing users with an estimate of what kind of financial assistance they may be eligible for could greatly inform their shopping experience &#8211; giving them a better idea of which products are in their budget, and whether they should shop your Health Care Marketplace products.</p> <p>Take a closer look at some of the benefits and risks of building your own subsidy estimator.</p> <p><strong>BENEFITS</strong><br /> A subsidy estimator can help users to determine whether they should be shopping On-Exchange or Off-Exchange Products. Critically, it can steer users to your On-Exchange Products through your Exchange-Integrated shopping experience, avoiding exposure to your competitors. For shoppers wondering if they should conduct an Official Eligibility Determination, a subsidy estimator can provide helpful guidance, giving users a sense of how much a Premium Tax Subsidy Amount might be. Because this valuable information is available directly from your shopping site, a subsidy estimator can help boost brand loyalty and consumer confidence.</p> <p><strong>RISKS</strong><br /> Managing expectation around accuracy is the most significant risk to building a subsidy calculator. The availability and variance of the portion of the premium that contributes to the Essential Health Benefits of the Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan is still unknown. A basic subsidy estimator would not accommodate atypical Coverage Families, or exception scenarios such as Native American rules or Insufficient Employer Coverage. A significant challenge will be to communicate the assumptions built in to your calculations without overwhelming the user.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com/index.php/do-you-need-a-subsidy-estimator/">Do You Need a Subsidy Estimator?</a> appeared first on <a href="http://blog.tahoepartners.com">TahoeSmart</a>.</p>
